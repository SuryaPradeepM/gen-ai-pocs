00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:04.002
<v Martin Peck>So I was hoping if you wrote it
down, I might remember it over</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/925-1
00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:06.408

<v Martin Peck>So what I'll do, please keep
you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/970-0
00:05:12.928 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Martin Peck>Keep this your open if there are
anything you know if if as we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/970-1
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.591
<v Martin Peck>are going through this hand over
there are things where you think</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/970-2
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:21.958
<v Martin Peck>actually on a bit more.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1001-0
00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:25.056
<v Martin Peck>No, I wanna know a bit more
about that or you didn't cover</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1001-1
00:05:25.056 --> 00:05:28.459
<v Martin Peck>that very well and you don't get
a chance to say that during the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1001-2
00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.878
<v Martin Peck>meeting.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1012-0
00:05:28.888 --> 00:05:31.348
<v Martin Peck>Please just drop those things
somewhere on this board.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1034-0
00:05:31.358 --> 00:05:34.142
<v Martin Peck>It doesn't really matter where
either next to the sessions or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1034-1
00:05:34.142 --> 00:05:35.938
<v Martin Peck>in the handover goals or
anywhere else.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1056-0
00:05:35.948 --> 00:05:41.164
<v Martin Peck>Just please use this as a a
place to interactively try and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1056-1
00:05:41.164 --> 00:05:46.558
<v Martin Peck>redirect or guide the current
session or following sessions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1075-0
00:05:46.768 --> 00:05:51.866
<v Martin Peck>So I'm gonna just zoom in a bit
and focus on what we're gonna</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1075-1
00:05:51.866 --> 00:05:53.018
<v Martin Peck>look at today.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1085-0
00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:55.758
<v Martin Peck>So I'm hoping to cover most of
this stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1092-0
00:05:55.768 --> 00:05:56.718
<v Martin Peck>Let's see how far we get.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1102-0
00:05:56.808 --> 00:05:58.338
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna start with a.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1121-0
00:05:58.348 --> 00:06:02.568
<v Martin Peck>Basically, I guess it sort of
road map, not Rd maps the wrong</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1121-1
00:06:02.568 --> 00:06:02.908
<v Martin Peck>word.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1127-0
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:03.918
<v Martin Peck>Sign signposts.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-0
00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:07.911
<v Martin Peck>Some stuff that we have, we have
a wiki, we have a backlog, we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-1
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:11.261
<v Martin Peck>have a bunch of code
repositories, may not go into a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-2
00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:14.991
<v Martin Peck>ton of detail around the code
repositories today, but just</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-3
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:19.164
<v Martin Peck>want to show you where those are
so that over the next week or so</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-4
00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:23.147
<v Martin Peck>you can at your leisure go to
these places and poke around and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-5
00:06:23.147 --> 00:06:27.256
<v Martin Peck>then in session two and session
three, you may come with sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-6
00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:31.112
<v Martin Peck>questions around those things
that are sort of been prompted</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-7
00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:35.095
<v Martin Peck>by you having looked around, I
think an assure you asked us to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1225-8
00:06:35.095 --> 00:06:35.538
<v Martin Peck>talk a.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1244-0
00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:38.155
<v Martin Peck>Little bit about the user
journey mapping, so we'll go</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1244-1
00:06:38.155 --> 00:06:39.388
<v Martin Peck>through point you at that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1272-0
00:06:41.478 --> 00:06:45.333
<v Martin Peck>I I'm sort of, I'd like to be
guided by you, but I was gonna</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1272-1
00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:48.178
<v Martin Peck>sort of like a lot of what we're
doing here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1307-0
00:06:48.188 --> 00:06:51.222
<v Martin Peck>A lot of this project is based
around this concept called RAG</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1307-1
00:06:51.222 --> 00:06:54.159
<v Martin Peck>and I wanna make sure that
everybody is on the same page in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1307-2
00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:56.068
<v Martin Peck>terms of what it is and what it
isn't.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1314-0
00:06:56.638 --> 00:06:59.128
<v Martin Peck>So umm, I don't know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1318-0
00:06:59.138 --> 00:07:00.708
<v Martin Peck>Could you perhaps, umm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1391-0
00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:04.895
<v Martin Peck>Maybe give me some sort of
indication of maybe raise your</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1391-1
00:07:04.895 --> 00:07:08.769
<v Martin Peck>hand if you if you feel that you
don't know a great deal about</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1391-2
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.398
<v Martin Peck>what RAG is, UM, if you can
raise your hand in the meeting</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1391-3
00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:16.087
<v Martin Peck>that just helped me know whether
I've got a meeting full of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1391-4
00:07:16.087 --> 00:07:19.777
<v Martin Peck>people who know exactly I'm
talking about or a meeting pool</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1391-5
00:07:19.777 --> 00:07:22.668
<v Martin Peck>of people who want to hear her
out this stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1407-0
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:27.197
<v Martin Peck>I guess again, the Microsoft
people don't need to have raise</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1407-1
00:07:27.197 --> 00:07:27.588
<v Martin Peck>their hand.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1416-0
00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:32.738
<v Martin Peck>Nobody's raising the hand.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1425-0
00:07:32.748 --> 00:07:36.648
<v Martin Peck>So, uh, well, we'll cover that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1430-0
00:07:36.658 --> 00:07:37.828
<v Martin Peck>The right concept stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1438-0
00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:41.538
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna go through the uh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1505-0
00:07:42.048 --> 00:07:46.774
<v Martin Peck>Partly through the the backlog,
but some of the experiments that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1505-1
00:07:46.774 --> 00:07:51.208
<v Martin Peck>we have run point at the data
we've been using and somewhere</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1505-2
00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:55.716
<v Martin Peck>along the lines we possibly when
I talk about the RAG concept</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1505-3
00:07:55.716 --> 00:08:00.224
<v Martin Peck>stuff that might actually sit
with that and go a demo that we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1505-4
00:08:00.224 --> 00:08:04.368
<v Martin Peck>did or that we provided for the
ECN, which was November.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1526-0
00:08:04.378 --> 00:08:08.470
<v Martin Peck>I think last year to the middle
of November, so that might help</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1526-1
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.388
<v Martin Peck>sort of set the scene as well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1535-0
00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:12.088
<v Martin Peck>That's what I'm hoping to do
today.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1544-0
00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:13.288
<v Martin Peck>Some things I won't be doing
today.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1556-0
00:08:13.298 --> 00:08:16.966
<v Martin Peck>I'm not gonna be necessarily
diving into the Python code and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1556-1
00:08:16.966 --> 00:08:17.568
<v Martin Peck>notebooks.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1608-0
00:08:17.858 --> 00:08:21.788
<v Martin Peck>I won't be going through the
Azure resources and services</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1608-1
00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:25.922
<v Martin Peck>that we've deployed and the pain
that we've had in deploying</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1608-2
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.921
<v Martin Peck>those and I won't be talking
about potential next steps or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1608-3
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:33.919
<v Martin Peck>potential challenges that we've
had or a or looking at the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1608-4
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.478
<v Martin Peck>future user experience.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1620-0
00:08:35.588 --> 00:08:38.468
<v Martin Peck>Those are all things that we're
planning in future sessions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1626-0
00:08:39.008 --> 00:08:40.138
<v Martin Peck>Is there anything I'm missing?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1635-0
00:08:40.148 --> 00:08:43.468
<v Martin Peck>Is anything that you're sat here
thinking?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1640-0
00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:44.188
<v Martin Peck>Well, hang on.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1757-0
00:08:44.378 --> 00:08:49.318
<v Martin Peck>I'm hoping to hear about X&amp;X
isn't on this board now is a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1757-1
00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:51.708
<v Martin Peck>good chance to highlight that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1670-0
00:08:58.578 --> 00:09:01.738
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>Maybe Martin, I have mentioned
it in the handover goals.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1691-0
00:09:02.728 --> 00:09:06.075
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>So so when you're, you know,
briefing up was setting up the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1691-1
00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:07.358
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>context of the project.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1722-0
00:09:07.368 --> 00:09:11.522
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>You know, please get into the
problem statement and you know</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1722-1
00:09:11.522 --> 00:09:15.948
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>what exactly that we are trying
to solve and experiment and what</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1722-2
00:09:15.948 --> 00:09:17.378
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>is the scope for MVP.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1739-0
00:09:17.568 --> 00:09:22.256
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>So that is the key for us to,
you know, understand the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1739-1
00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:24.558
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>following sessions as well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1750-0
00:09:24.568 --> 00:09:27.378
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>So if you could set up that
context like what?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1786-0
00:09:27.388 --> 00:09:31.633
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>What problem are we trying to
solve and why did we choose this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1766-0
00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:29.638
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1786-1
00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:35.811
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>approach and what what did we
try to do during the experiment</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1786-2
00:09:35.811 --> 00:09:37.968
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>stage and what what do you want?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1798-0
00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.188
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>What do we want to achieve in
the MVP stage?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1808-0
00:09:40.748 --> 00:09:40.968
<v Martin Peck>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1811-0
00:09:42.468 --> 00:09:43.398
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, cool.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1816-0
00:09:43.448 --> 00:09:44.468
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, that makes sense.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1823-0
00:09:44.848 --> 00:09:46.548
<v Martin Peck>OK, I'm gonna switch my screen.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1840-0
00:09:46.558 --> 00:09:51.028
<v Martin Peck>I'm going over to my cloud PC,
so let me just Sheridan screen.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1874-0
00:09:59.408 --> 00:10:04.158
<v Martin Peck>OK, I'm going to start umm with
basically sort of pointing at</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1874-1
00:10:04.158 --> 00:10:08.678
<v Martin Peck>some of the things that you can
go and look at yourselves.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1884-0
00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:10.258
<v Martin Peck>And so I guess some resources.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1887-0
00:10:11.248 --> 00:10:11.838
<v Martin Peck>Can I?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1898-0
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:15.858
<v Martin Peck>Does anybody not have access to
this wiki?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1913-0
00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:22.294
<v Martin Peck>Has anybody not been here and
looked at the handover session</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1913-1
00:10:22.294 --> 00:10:22.818
<v Martin Peck>list?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1938-0
00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:33.667
<v Sahni, Aniksha>Our nomadic, I think from all
uh, from our end, I think</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1938-1
00:10:33.667 --> 00:10:35.398
<v Sahni, Aniksha>everyone has access to the
DevOps.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1940-0
00:10:36.898 --> 00:10:37.328
<v Martin Peck>I'll check.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1942-0
00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:39.408
<v Martin Peck>Cool. OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1959-0
00:10:42.598 --> 00:10:45.693
<v Martin Peck>And they just, that's not great,
but not I'll total these up</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1959-1
00:10:45.693 --> 00:10:45.998
<v Martin Peck>later.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/1979-0
00:10:46.108 --> 00:10:48.638
<v Martin Peck>So I've I've just dropped the
the URL to this handover thing.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2003-0
00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:53.447
<v Martin Peck>Anyway, if you didn't have it to
hand, then it might be worth</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2003-1
00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:57.008
<v Martin Peck>opening it if you want to in
this session so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2046-0
00:10:59.188 --> 00:11:01.819
<v Martin Peck>Throughout the projects,
throughout the sort of four or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2046-1
00:11:01.819 --> 00:11:04.497
<v Martin Peck>so months that we've been
working, there are a number of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2046-2
00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.894
<v Martin Peck>places where we've been
collecting information and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2046-3
00:11:06.894 --> 00:11:09.196
<v Martin Peck>that's the stuff that
essentially you know, it's</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2046-4
00:11:09.196 --> 00:11:09.478
<v Martin Peck>yours.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2051-0
00:11:09.648 --> 00:11:11.018
<v Martin Peck>We're handing it over to you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2081-0
00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:16.374
<v Martin Peck>It's sitting in an Azure DevOps
instance that Novartis set up</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2081-1
00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:21.208
<v Martin Peck>for us so that the first thing
to point out is this wiki.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2116-0
00:11:21.218 --> 00:11:26.265
<v Martin Peck>So if you come to the the home
of this as your DevOps instance,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2116-1
00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:31.155
<v Martin Peck>there is a let me just expand
that cause you probably look at</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2116-2
00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:32.338
<v Martin Peck>that like this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2123-0
00:11:32.568 --> 00:11:34.918
<v Martin Peck>There is a wiki under the
overview section.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2135-0
00:11:35.168 --> 00:11:40.216
<v Martin Peck>This is where we have collected
notes, meeting notes, written up</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2135-1
00:11:40.216 --> 00:11:41.148
<v Martin Peck>experiments.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2173-0
00:11:43.028 --> 00:11:47.202
<v Martin Peck>I I can't claim that they're all
like perfect or that they are</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2173-1
00:11:47.202 --> 00:11:51.377
<v Martin Peck>all written up neatly, but they
but we have a a quite a bit of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2173-2
00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.558
<v Martin Peck>information here and it's worth
reviewing this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2203-0
00:11:57.418 --> 00:12:00.036
<v Martin Peck>The structure of this is such
that we have the, you know, the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2203-1
00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.739
<v Martin Peck>exec summary and some, you know,
some stuff around our team and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2203-2
00:12:02.739 --> 00:12:03.288
<v Martin Peck>stakeholders.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2229-0
00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:08.009
<v Martin Peck>There's a section called
Experimentation Game Plan under</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2229-1
00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:11.668
<v Martin Peck>which you will find information
about the experiments.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2261-0
00:12:11.758 --> 00:12:15.735
<v Martin Peck>Although essentially yeah, the
the work that we've done over</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2261-1
00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:19.516
<v Martin Peck>the last couple of months,
experiment one and two, two in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2261-2
00:12:19.516 --> 00:12:23.428
<v Martin Peck>particular has, excuse me, a
fair amount of write up there.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2271-0
00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:25.208
<v Martin Peck>So that's the experimentation
game plan.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2273-0
00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:27.138
<v Martin Peck>There are some.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2325-0
00:12:29.018 --> 00:12:33.084
<v Martin Peck>I essentially docs that we've
used as part of either</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2325-1
00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:38.071
<v Martin Peck>discussions, meetings design, so
some notes you know, as you can</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2325-2
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:42.675
<v Martin Peck>see, sort of fairly informal
diagrams about how things work</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2325-3
00:12:42.675 --> 00:12:47.048
<v Martin Peck>or how things are sort of set up
as part of the process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2385-0
00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:51.309
<v Martin Peck>So the Microsoft team have all
been working on these cloud PC S</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2385-1
00:12:51.309 --> 00:12:54.922
<v Martin Peck>and a lot of what we have been
doing over the past couple of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2385-2
00:12:54.922 --> 00:12:58.299
<v Martin Peck>months is fighting with this
setup either to try and get</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2385-3
00:12:58.299 --> 00:13:01.675
<v Martin Peck>things installed or get things
configured so that we can</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2385-4
00:13:01.675 --> 00:13:03.808
<v Martin Peck>actually do the work we want to
do.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2438-0
00:13:04.518 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Martin Peck>That may or may not be of any
interest to you, or useful to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2438-1
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.115
<v Martin Peck>you, but those things are
sitting most of the developer</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2438-2
00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:14.528
<v Martin Peck>guides are around how to set up
how to get set up as a with</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2438-3
00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:17.258
<v Martin Peck>Novartis idea how to get your
cloud PC working.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2442-0
00:13:17.708 --> 00:13:19.398
<v Martin Peck>How to yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2452-0
00:13:19.448 --> 00:13:22.068
<v Martin Peck>How to deploy things into uh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2457-0
00:13:22.548 --> 00:13:22.888
<v Martin Peck>It was.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2463-0
00:13:22.898 --> 00:13:24.218
<v Martin Peck>You're from these machines.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2483-0
00:13:24.788 --> 00:13:28.453
<v Martin Peck>As I said this, this will sort
of would likely to sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2483-1
00:13:28.453 --> 00:13:30.728
<v Martin Peck>summarize some of this in terms
of.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2532-0
00:13:33.248 --> 00:13:36.537
<v Martin Peck>This will be useful for anybody
else who comes along after us</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2532-1
00:13:36.537 --> 00:13:39.774
<v Martin Peck>and has to have a similar sort
of development set up, but it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2532-2
00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:43.116
<v Martin Peck>may not be exactly relevant to
entirely relevant to someone in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2532-3
00:13:43.116 --> 00:13:44.708
<v Martin Peck>the past who works from there.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2563-0
00:13:46.148 --> 00:13:49.803
<v Martin Peck>From that PC, from that laptop,
it's section here around the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2563-1
00:13:49.803 --> 00:13:53.398
<v Martin Peck>data that we've either requested
or that we have access to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2591-0
00:13:54.748 --> 00:13:58.547
<v Martin Peck>These handover notes are sitting
here and there's a few meeting</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2591-1
00:13:58.547 --> 00:14:01.338
<v Martin Peck>notes in here as well, so that's
the wiki the.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2623-0
00:14:01.178 --> 00:14:05.701
<v Brinth, Alette>Start light and I I just had a a
comment slash question you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2623-1
00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:10.375
<v Brinth, Alette>mentioned about the cloud PC's
and some of the issues you had</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2623-2
00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:11.808
<v Brinth, Alette>in setting them up.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2634-0
00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:14.888
<v Brinth, Alette>It would be helpful for us to
have to have that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2651-0
00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:18.333
<v Brinth, Alette>I think you mentioned before you
might write a a list or or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2651-1
00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:20.108

00:14:20.118 --> 00:14:23.652
<v Brinth, Alette>I just for our awareness, I
think we're always looking for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2676-1
00:14:23.652 --> 00:14:26.408
<v Brinth, Alette>feedback and I have been asked

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2698-0
00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:28.658
<v Brinth, Alette>So we will be great to be able
to pass it on.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2705-0
00:14:28.818 --> 00:14:31.688
<v Martin Peck>The the and we can try and do
that the the main.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2723-0
00:14:31.838 --> 00:14:36.072
<v Martin Peck>My main comment on the main sort
of piece of advice is try it for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2723-1
00:14:36.072 --> 00:14:36.778
<v Martin Peck>yourselves.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2769-0
00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:41.182
<v Martin Peck>So so I was just anybody who,
you know, I I would encourage</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2769-1
00:14:41.182 --> 00:14:45.503
<v Martin Peck>I'm I someone to spin up a
request a cloud PC and then try</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2769-2
00:14:45.503 --> 00:14:49.238
<v Martin Peck>to do work on it try to do
development work on it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2780-0
00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:50.198
<v Martin Peck>I think you'll vote.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2777-0
00:14:49.618 --> 00:14:51.448
<v Brinth, Alette>No, I appreciate that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2815-0
00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.505
<v Brinth, Alette>But for those of us who aren't
able to do that, I think I'm</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2802-0
00:14:54.308 --> 00:14:54.599
<v Martin Peck>I E.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2815-1
00:14:54.505 --> 00:14:57.551
<v Brinth, Alette>being asked, you know, so it
would be good if if just great</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2815-2
00:14:57.551 --> 00:14:59.278
<v Brinth, Alette>to hear your experiences with
it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2829-0
00:14:59.378 --> 00:15:00.788
<v Brinth, Alette>And and a couple of comments.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2825-0
00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:02.198
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2868-0
00:15:02.288 --> 00:15:06.058
<v Martin Peck>And we will try to do that, but
I would and so are you saying</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2868-1
00:15:06.058 --> 00:15:09.888
<v Martin Peck>that someone in the artist could
not request the cloud PC from</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2868-2
00:15:09.888 --> 00:15:10.618
<v Martin Peck>Novartis so?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2895-0
00:15:10.098 --> 00:15:13.017
<v Brinth, Alette>No, no, I'm just saying that
when I receive a mail, it would</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2895-1
00:15:13.017 --> 00:15:16.176
<v Brinth, Alette>be useful for me to know exactly
what you as I SE team experience</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2895-2
00:15:16.176 --> 00:15:18.808
<v Brinth, Alette>so that we can pass that
information back as feedback.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2919-0
00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:22.922
<v Brinth, Alette>You know, I'm sure there's many
people on this call from, like,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2919-1
00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:25.488
<v Brinth, Alette>the DDIT team who were able to
do that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2923-0
00:15:25.498 --> 00:15:25.808
<v Brinth, Alette>But I'm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2948-0
00:15:25.818 --> 00:15:27.907
<v Brinth, Alette>I just mean just to just to
elaborate on your comment you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2948-1
00:15:27.907 --> 00:15:29.708
<v Brinth, Alette>asked if it would be useful
would be very useful.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2960-0
00:15:29.858 --> 00:15:30.228
<v Brinth, Alette>Thank you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/2958-0
00:15:30.288 --> 00:15:31.018
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, I.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-0
00:15:31.148 --> 00:15:34.916
<v Martin Peck>But I would suggest the the best
advice I can give is that if</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-1
00:15:34.916 --> 00:15:38.623
<v Martin Peck>someone is picking up this code
and wants to sort of try and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-2
00:15:38.623 --> 00:15:42.269
<v Martin Peck>deploy some of these things,
provision of cloud PC and then</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-3
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.794
<v Martin Peck>work through this and there's
there's nothing better than</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-4
00:15:45.794 --> 00:15:49.319
<v Martin Peck>hitting those issues yourself
and realizing ohh OK, Now I</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-5
00:15:49.319 --> 00:15:52.965
<v Martin Peck>understand why these proxy
settings are are sort of getting</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3036-6
00:15:52.965 --> 00:15:53.938
<v Martin Peck>in people's way.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3064-0
00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:58.246
<v Martin Peck>So and that's I think so we can
write those things up, but the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3064-1
00:15:58.246 --> 00:16:01.558
<v Martin Peck>lift experience is much more
useful I think the.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3061-0
00:16:01.758 --> 00:16:02.758
<v Brinth, Alette>I appreciate that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3067-0
00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:03.328
<v Brinth, Alette>Thank you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3071-0
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:04.828
<v Brinth, Alette>But we're pretty, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3072-0
00:16:05.658 --> 00:16:05.798
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3083-0
00:16:07.908 --> 00:16:10.838
<v Martin Peck>The so that's the the wiki.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3093-0
00:16:10.848 --> 00:16:13.018
<v Martin Peck>The next thing is just to
quickly show case.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3101-0
00:16:13.028 --> 00:16:14.378
<v Martin Peck>We're not gonna focus on this
too much.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3111-0
00:16:14.388 --> 00:16:16.158
<v Martin Peck>We'll skip is is a repositories.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3127-0
00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:20.887
<v Martin Peck>There are a number of kits
repositories in this you know</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3127-1
00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:22.378
<v Martin Peck>Dev, OPS instance.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3135-0
00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:25.388
<v Martin Peck>We have one for the ECN demo.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3145-0
00:16:25.398 --> 00:16:26.648
<v Martin Peck>We'll be talking about that a
little bit later.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3152-0
00:16:29.748 --> 00:16:30.838
<v Martin Peck>I think that was empty.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3174-0
00:16:31.008 --> 00:16:33.551
<v Martin Peck>We have a repository which is
essentially the wiki, so the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3174-1
00:16:33.551 --> 00:16:35.578
<v Martin Peck>wiki I've just showed you is a
git repository.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3195-0
00:16:38.448 --> 00:16:43.567
<v Martin Peck>There is a repository that is
the RAG experiment accelerator,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3195-1
00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:48.438
<v Martin Peck>and we'll be talking about that
a bit more later tomorrow.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3209-0
00:16:48.708 --> 00:16:53.538
<v Martin Peck>But essentially this is code
that is that we have Reddy.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3231-0
00:16:54.318 --> 00:16:57.998
<v Martin Peck>No, there was sort of prepared
for experiment three, which</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3231-1
00:16:57.998 --> 00:17:00.618
<v Martin Peck>we've never got around to, to to
running.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3235-0
00:17:00.628 --> 00:17:02.138
<v Martin Peck>But essentially, we'll talk
about that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3244-0
00:17:02.928 --> 00:17:04.608
<v Martin Peck>I can't remember what test repo
is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3252-0
00:17:04.618 --> 00:17:05.568
<v Martin Peck>It's probably nothing at all.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3254-0
00:17:07.538 --> 00:17:07.888
<v Martin Peck>It's.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3264-0
00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:10.398
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, it's nothing at all.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3286-0
00:17:10.408 --> 00:17:15.000
<v Martin Peck>But anyway, the various
repositories are sat here in in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3286-1
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.756
<v Martin Peck>Azure DevOps and so next I want
to sort of talk about the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3286-2
00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:20.658
<v Martin Peck>backlog so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3327-0
00:17:22.978 --> 00:17:27.212
<v Martin Peck>If you are, if you come into
Azure DevOps, uh, and go to this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3327-1
00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:31.173
<v Martin Peck>backlogs view and probably
you'll need to, you'll come in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3327-2
00:17:31.173 --> 00:17:33.768
<v Martin Peck>and it will look something like
this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3376-0
00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:37.204
<v Martin Peck>If you switch this up into to
showing epics rather than</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3376-1
00:17:37.204 --> 00:17:41.014
<v Martin Peck>features or stories, then you'll
get this hierarchical view of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3376-2
00:17:41.014 --> 00:17:44.582
<v Martin Peck>the backlog, which I think is
probably the the best way to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3376-3
00:17:44.582 --> 00:17:47.848
<v Martin Peck>sort of get a high level view of
the work we've done.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3390-0
00:17:48.858 --> 00:17:51.368
<v Martin Peck>You can see that these you know
in various different states.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3408-0
00:17:51.958 --> 00:17:58.452
<v Martin Peck>Essentially, we started off Umm
probably around here, working on</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3408-1
00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:03.048
<v Martin Peck>an ECN demo and and and setting
ourselves up.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3422-0
00:18:03.058 --> 00:18:07.550
<v Martin Peck>This is basically work around
getting access to things we've</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3422-1
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.728
<v Martin Peck>spent some time.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3445-0
00:18:11.148 --> 00:18:14.506
<v Martin Peck>Defining what a potential next
user experience might look like</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3445-1
00:18:14.506 --> 00:18:16.798
<v Martin Peck>or future user experience might
look like.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3465-0
00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:20.021
<v Martin Peck>We're gonna talk about that a
little bit later and those are</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3465-1
00:18:20.021 --> 00:18:21.178
<v Martin Peck>work items related to that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3488-0
00:18:24.088 --> 00:18:29.192
<v Martin Peck>While we've been waiting for
data, we've been, uh, working on</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3488-1
00:18:29.192 --> 00:18:33.968
<v Martin Peck>on the code base to allow us to
run parallel experiments.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3501-0
00:18:34.478 --> 00:18:36.208
<v Martin Peck>I'll talk about that a little
bit later as well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3522-0
00:18:36.918 --> 00:18:40.670
<v Martin Peck>And then essentially, we've got
the the work related to the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3522-1
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.048
<v Martin Peck>various experiments that we've
we've been performing.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3528-0
00:18:44.398 --> 00:18:45.618
<v Martin Peck>I I'm gonna talk about the work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3559-0
00:18:45.628 --> 00:18:48.885
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna keep saying the word
experiments, and you're gonna</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3559-1
00:18:48.885 --> 00:18:52.250
<v Martin Peck>see the word experiments and not
in in the code base or in the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3559-2
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.478
<v Martin Peck>backlog or in the wiki.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3601-0
00:18:53.948 --> 00:18:59.160
<v Martin Peck>And there's probably nothing
sort of magical or special going</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3601-1
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.952
<v Martin Peck>on here other than we have
written some code to prove or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3601-2
00:19:03.952 --> 00:19:09.081
<v Martin Peck>disprove or to sort of help us
move forward on a on a bigger</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3601-3
00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:10.258
<v Martin Peck>piece of work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3674-0
00:19:10.408 --> 00:19:13.937
<v Martin Peck>So each of these experiments is
essentially us saying do we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3674-1
00:19:13.937 --> 00:19:17.643
<v Martin Peck>think we can do something and
then writing the smallest amount</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3674-2
00:19:17.643 --> 00:19:20.879
<v Martin Peck>of code possible to prove
whether we can or can't do a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3674-3
00:19:20.879 --> 00:19:24.762
<v Martin Peck>thing or to sort of come up with
a sort of a hypothesis or a, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3674-4
00:19:24.762 --> 00:19:28.232
<v Martin Peck>know, and and for another
question where we can say, well,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3674-5
00:19:28.232 --> 00:19:31.468
<v Martin Peck>actually this didn't really work
out how we wanted it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3680-0
00:19:31.588 --> 00:19:32.798
<v Martin Peck>What could we do differently?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3687-0
00:19:32.808 --> 00:19:34.238
<v Martin Peck>What should we change here?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3698-0
00:19:34.248 --> 00:19:37.298
<v Martin Peck>And then we come up with another
piece of work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3717-0
00:19:39.908 --> 00:19:43.512
<v Martin Peck>This is all those experiments
are so we've spent some time at</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3717-1
00:19:43.512 --> 00:19:45.198
<v Martin Peck>the beginning of the project.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3726-0
00:19:46.148 --> 00:19:49.798
<v Martin Peck>Uh, looking at synthetic
dossiers?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3754-0
00:19:49.858 --> 00:19:53.482
<v Martin Peck>Uh, we've spent some time
looking at sort of how we might</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3754-1
00:19:53.482 --> 00:19:57.231
<v Martin Peck>sort of use historic health
authority questions to retrieve</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3754-2
00:19:57.231 --> 00:19:58.418
<v Martin Peck>relevant questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3791-0
00:19:58.548 --> 00:20:01.511
<v Martin Peck>I'm going to talk about all of
these things in a bit more</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3791-1
00:20:01.511 --> 00:20:04.372
<v Martin Peck>detail later, but essentially
the work related to these</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3791-2
00:20:04.372 --> 00:20:07.029
<v Martin Peck>experiments is sort of
hierarchically stacked under</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3791-3
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.898
<v Martin Peck>these work items.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3799-0
00:20:07.908 --> 00:20:09.038
<v Martin Peck>So you can see experiment too.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3812-0
00:20:09.088 --> 00:20:12.548
<v Martin Peck>For example, there was there's
been quite a bit of work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3824-0
00:20:12.558 --> 00:20:13.278
<v Martin Peck>Some of it is closed.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3868-0
00:20:13.288 --> 00:20:17.645
<v Martin Peck>Some of its resolved one or two
bits and pieces are still active</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3868-1
00:20:17.645 --> 00:20:21.936
<v Martin Peck>as we write things up, and those
are all sitting there, so that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3868-2
00:20:21.936 --> 00:20:25.958
<v Martin Peck>hopefully as pointed out where
these things are, we will go</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3868-3
00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:28.908
<v Martin Peck>into more detail about all of
these things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3907-0
00:20:28.998 --> 00:20:32.647
<v Martin Peck>Later, but over the course of
the these three sessions, most</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3907-1
00:20:32.647 --> 00:20:36.056
<v Martin Peck>of the stuff we're gonna be
showing fit somewhere in the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3907-2
00:20:36.056 --> 00:20:38.688
<v Martin Peck>backlog or in the wiki or in the
code base.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3935-0
00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:41.859
<v Martin Peck>And if it doesn't sit in one of
those three places, then please</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3935-1
00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:44.776
<v Martin Peck>shout because it probably means
we're not handing it over to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3935-2
00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:44.968
<v Martin Peck>you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3951-0
00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:51.454
<v Martin Peck>But OK, before I'm gonna move on
to the user journey mapping</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3951-1
00:20:51.454 --> 00:20:52.078
<v Martin Peck>stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3968-0
00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:55.790
<v Martin Peck>Any questions or any comments,
anything anybody wants to say</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3968-1
00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.368
<v Martin Peck>anything before I do that?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3972-0
00:21:03.528 --> 00:21:04.978
<v Martin Peck>OK, cool.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3983-0
00:21:05.768 --> 00:21:07.908
<v Martin Peck>So why are we doing any of this
stuff?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3991-0
00:21:08.468 --> 00:21:10.698
<v Martin Peck>I guess is one way of putting
this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/3994-0
00:21:10.748 --> 00:21:11.308
<v Martin Peck>This is a.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4017-0
00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:16.809
<v Martin Peck>Let me show you where you can
find this if you want to look at</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4017-1
00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:18.818
<v Martin Peck>yourself within the wiki.
Brilliant.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4049-0
00:21:22.288 --> 00:21:26.315
<v Martin Peck>I've had a couple of issues this
morning where as your DevOps has</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4049-1
00:21:26.315 --> 00:21:29.976
<v Martin Peck>not been accessible from my
cloud PC, so hopefully we won't</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4049-2
00:21:29.976 --> 00:21:31.318
<v Martin Peck>see too many of those.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4055-0
00:21:34.828 --> 00:21:37.568
<v Martin Peck>Under the where is it?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4080-0
00:21:40.108 --> 00:21:44.351
<v Martin Peck>Under the Experimentation Plan,
user experience, user gender,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4080-1
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:48.458
<v Martin Peck>gender mapping, I'm opening the
PDF that's referenced here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4105-0
00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:54.325
<v Martin Peck>So all you have that open and
just maximize that we spent some</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4105-1
00:21:54.325 --> 00:21:59.588
<v Martin Peck>time talking to the artist
business users to understand.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4112-0
00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:03.658
<v Martin Peck>What they do when so?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4167-0
00:22:03.668 --> 00:22:06.739
<v Martin Peck>Health authorities raise
questions about drug</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4167-1
00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Martin Peck>submissions, and they post those
questions, send us questions to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4167-2
00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.886
<v Martin Peck>Novartis and then Novartis goes
through a fairly lengthy</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4167-3
00:22:14.886 --> 00:22:19.092
<v Martin Peck>process, which is the thing at
the top of the screen to get to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4167-4
00:22:19.092 --> 00:22:22.498
<v Martin Peck>a point where they can respond
to those questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4220-0
00:22:22.768 --> 00:22:26.964
<v Martin Peck>Responding to those questions
involves receiving them and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4220-1
00:22:26.964 --> 00:22:31.161
<v Martin Peck>copying those questions into,
you know, from from the the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4220-2
00:22:31.161 --> 00:22:35.285
<v Martin Peck>system that receives as
questions into word templates to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4220-3
00:22:35.285 --> 00:22:39.264
<v Martin Peck>sending those word documents
around to people, getting</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4220-4
00:22:39.264 --> 00:22:43.678
<v Martin Peck>experts to, to look at those
questions, those experts again.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4225-0
00:22:45.488 --> 00:22:46.818
<v Martin Peck>Uh review.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4272-0
00:22:47.428 --> 00:22:52.050
<v Martin Peck>You know that they use their own
subject matter, expert</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4272-1
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.919
<v Martin Peck>expertise, their own various
resources within the basis to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4272-2
00:22:56.919 --> 00:23:01.788
<v Martin Peck>come to some draft response to
that question and then that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4272-3
00:23:01.788 --> 00:23:06.328
<v Martin Peck>draft response is is reviewed
and if finally approved.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4281-0
00:23:06.338 --> 00:23:08.368
<v Martin Peck>And then finally, the response.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-0
00:23:08.378 --> 00:23:13.287
<v Martin Peck>The answer to that question that
was submitted by the Health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-1
00:23:13.287 --> 00:23:17.954
<v Martin Peck>Authority is returned to the
Health authority for them to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-2
00:23:17.954 --> 00:23:22.461
<v Martin Peck>consume, and essentially that's
the this in a very in a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-3
00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:27.611
<v Martin Peck>nutshell, the top row here and
the idea was to look for ways of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-4
00:23:27.611 --> 00:23:31.957
<v Martin Peck>making that process more
efficient, quicker and where</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-5
00:23:31.957 --> 00:23:37.027
<v Martin Peck>possible, using generative AI
and large language models to uh,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-6
00:23:37.027 --> 00:23:41.694
<v Martin Peck>to take some of the heavy
lifting out of that out of that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4359-7
00:23:41.694 --> 00:23:42.338
<v Martin Peck>process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4376-0
00:23:42.528 --> 00:23:46.176
<v Martin Peck>And that's probably two places
where that, that's that might be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4376-1
00:23:46.176 --> 00:23:47.088
<v Martin Peck>possible one is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4408-0
00:23:49.398 --> 00:23:54.051
<v Martin Peck>There's a there's some amount of
work involved in, well, there's</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4408-1
00:23:54.051 --> 00:23:58.275
<v Martin Peck>a whole bunch of preparation on
the left hand side of this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4408-2
00:23:58.275 --> 00:24:00.208
<v Martin Peck>diagram that could be more.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4458-0
00:24:02.118 --> 00:24:06.575
<v Martin Peck>We more streamlined, so there's
a lot of copy paste opening word</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4458-1
00:24:06.575 --> 00:24:10.689
<v Martin Peck>templates, so none of this is
particularly, they're focused</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4458-2
00:24:10.689 --> 00:24:14.871
<v Martin Peck>around generative AI or large
language models, but there are</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4458-3
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:19.259
<v Martin Peck>process improvements that could
be made here to streamline this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4458-4
00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:19.808
<v Martin Peck>process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4479-0
00:24:21.688 --> 00:24:25.648
<v Martin Peck>We've this diagram sort of
talks, sorry.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4534-0
00:24:23.438 --> 00:24:28.246
<v Brinth, Alette>And Martin, I was sorry to to
ask so many questions, but one</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4534-1
00:24:28.246 --> 00:24:33.054
<v Brinth, Alette>of the one of the thing, one of
the things that came into my</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4534-2
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:38.177
<v Brinth, Alette>mind when I was looking at this
yesterday was umm with with this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4534-3
00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:43.143
<v Brinth, Alette>user journey mapped out we had
we kind of approached this with</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4534-4
00:24:43.143 --> 00:24:44.798
<v Brinth, Alette>the solution in mind.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4536-0
00:24:44.888 --> 00:24:45.258
<v Brinth, Alette>Umm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4585-0
00:24:45.268 --> 00:24:48.048
<v Brinth, Alette>And with this user journey
mapped out, there's it's.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4589-0
00:24:48.058 --> 00:24:52.500
<v Brinth, Alette>You can view it from the needs
basis rather than the solution</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4589-1
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:57.157
<v Brinth, Alette>basis and instead just like you
said, approach a lot of a lot of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4589-2
00:24:57.157 --> 00:25:00.811
<v Brinth, Alette>this this journey with
automation or generative AI</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4589-3
00:25:00.811 --> 00:25:01.528
<v Brinth, Alette>solutions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4647-0
00:25:03.158 --> 00:25:07.271
<v Brinth, Alette>Is there value in double
clicking in your opinion on this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4647-1
00:25:07.271 --> 00:25:11.669
<v Brinth, Alette>process and saying well this is
the entire process and beyond</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4647-2
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:15.853
<v Brinth, Alette>the scope of the MVE could we
see three or four additional</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4647-3
00:25:15.853 --> 00:25:19.612
<v Brinth, Alette>Jenny is smaller use cases
within here that we could</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4647-4
00:25:19.612 --> 00:25:24.080
<v Brinth, Alette>experiment with novatron being
like the North Star vision that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4647-5
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:24.648
<v Brinth, Alette>we have.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4655-0
00:25:26.558 --> 00:25:28.008
<v Martin Peck>I yeah, I think so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4663-0
00:25:28.018 --> 00:25:29.138
<v Martin Peck>I I think so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4670-0
00:25:29.148 --> 00:25:30.778
<v Martin Peck>If you're if what you're saying.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4729-0
00:25:30.818 --> 00:25:35.151
<v Martin Peck>So I think there's I one of the
things that I think we've we've</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4729-1
00:25:35.151 --> 00:25:39.146
<v Martin Peck>we struggled with some of the
beginning of the project was</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4729-2
00:25:39.146 --> 00:25:43.276
<v Martin Peck>actually what are you trying to
improve because as you say I</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4729-3
00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Martin Peck>think the beginning of the
project was we want to find</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4729-4
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.318
<v Martin Peck>applications for generative AI
within the boxes.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4778-0
00:25:50.328 --> 00:25:54.896
<v Martin Peck>And if you're sort of saying
I've got this solution, I wanna</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4778-1
00:25:54.896 --> 00:25:59.015
<v Martin Peck>find problems it might solve
that's you look at things</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4778-2
00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:03.508
<v Martin Peck>differently to to this view,
which is essentially saying we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4778-3
00:26:03.508 --> 00:26:08.301
<v Martin Peck>have this quite complex process
that is either you're costly or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4778-4
00:26:08.301 --> 00:26:10.398
<v Martin Peck>time-consuming, error prone.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4811-0
00:26:11.408 --> 00:26:15.996
<v Martin Peck>Ohh, difficult to train people
on whatever you know this this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4811-1
00:26:15.996 --> 00:26:20.510
<v Martin Peck>thing at the top here may be may
have all sorts of issues or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4811-2
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.508
<v Martin Peck>things you want to improve.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4819-0
00:26:22.898 --> 00:26:24.668
<v Martin Peck>What can we do to improve those
things?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4828-0
00:26:24.678 --> 00:26:25.968
<v Martin Peck>Like, how can we make it faster?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4837-0
00:26:25.978 --> 00:26:27.248
<v Martin Peck>How can make it more reliable?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4846-0
00:26:27.258 --> 00:26:29.528
<v Martin Peck>Or how can we make it cheaper?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4906-0
00:26:29.538 --> 00:26:34.535
<v Martin Peck>Whatever that you're trying to
improve, you would probably take</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4906-1
00:26:34.535 --> 00:26:39.299
<v Martin Peck>those those metrics that you're
trying to change and come up</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4906-2
00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:44.140
<v Martin Peck>with a solution that aimed at
those rather than the answer to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4906-3
00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:48.981
<v Martin Peck>those, to sum all of those may
not be generative AI, it might</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4906-4
00:26:48.981 --> 00:26:53.198
<v Martin Peck>be well, OK, we need to uh,
train people differently.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4930-0
00:26:53.208 --> 00:26:57.292
<v Martin Peck>We need to sort of deploy some
different, you know, don't using</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4930-1
00:26:57.292 --> 00:27:00.738
<v Martin Peck>word and start using some
something else or whatever.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4947-0
00:27:00.748 --> 00:27:04.439
<v Martin Peck>That is, the answers to those
questions may not be generative</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4947-1
00:27:04.439 --> 00:27:04.618
<v Martin Peck>AI.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4964-0
00:27:04.888 --> 00:27:09.991
<v Martin Peck>So I think if you were going to
look at this process and for us</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4964-1
00:27:09.991 --> 00:27:11.108
<v Martin Peck>to improve it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4976-0
00:27:11.248 --> 00:27:12.938
<v Martin Peck>Umm yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4999-0
00:27:12.948 --> 00:27:16.608
<v Martin Peck>I I think you you start you do
the slightly differently too,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4999-1
00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:20.328
<v Martin Peck>but but they are I guess our
hypothesis in the middle here is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/4999-2
00:27:20.328 --> 00:27:21.468
<v Martin Peck>that at some point.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5032-0
00:27:23.488 --> 00:27:26.900
<v Martin Peck>The you sleep land large
language models and generative</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5032-1
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.861
<v Martin Peck>dialogue is likely to help some
or yeah, at least one or more of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5032-2
00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:31.958
<v Martin Peck>the steps in here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5089-0
00:27:33.558 --> 00:27:38.184
<v Brinth, Alette>Yeah, I think that's kind of
what I'm was thinking last night</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5089-1
00:27:38.184 --> 00:27:42.289
<v Brinth, Alette>and maybe one other really
useful output from the user</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5089-2
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:46.691
<v Brinth, Alette>experience analysis that we
spent time on together is your</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5089-3
00:27:46.691 --> 00:27:51.542
<v Brinth, Alette>perspective on if this was not a
knowledge transfer session, but</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5089-4
00:27:51.542 --> 00:27:52.288
<v Brinth, Alette>a kickoff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5095-0
00:27:52.398 --> 00:27:56.908
<v Brinth, Alette>Where would you do your
experiments for?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5110-0
00:27:56.978 --> 00:28:00.398
<v Brinth, Alette>For for the use of generative AI
in the preparing, answering and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5110-1
00:28:00.398 --> 00:28:01.398
<v Brinth, Alette>submitting process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5113-0
00:28:05.258 --> 00:28:05.888
<v Martin Peck>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5118-0
00:28:05.938 --> 00:28:06.248
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5133-0
00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:10.802
<v Martin Peck>I'm so potentially we can cover
that in the third session</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5133-1
00:28:10.802 --> 00:28:13.858
<v Martin Peck>around, you know the potential
future.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5140-0
00:28:14.148 --> 00:28:15.278
<v Martin Peck>Umm yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5142-0
00:28:15.288 --> 00:28:16.258
<v Martin Peck>Experiments I.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5145-0
00:28:17.308 --> 00:28:17.598
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5155-0
00:28:17.608 --> 00:28:18.988
<v Martin Peck>Look, we have to have to think
about it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5159-0
00:28:18.998 --> 00:28:19.328
<v Martin Peck>I'm not sure.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5161-0
00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:21.558
<v Martin Peck>Umm yeah?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5207-0
00:28:23.488 --> 00:28:26.844
<v Brinth, Alette>I guess what I'm getting at is
like if we were saying instead</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5178-0
00:28:23.808 --> 00:28:24.128
<v Martin Peck>Not sure.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5207-1
00:28:26.844 --> 00:28:30.038
<v Brinth, Alette>of saying we want to answer
health authority questions and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5207-2
00:28:30.038 --> 00:28:33.016
<v Brinth, Alette>responses, we were saying we
want to respond to health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5207-3
00:28:33.016 --> 00:28:34.478
<v Brinth, Alette>authority questions faster.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5213-0
00:28:34.908 --> 00:28:36.518
<v Brinth, Alette>Here's our user journey.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5211-0
00:28:35.078 --> 00:28:35.288
<v Martin Peck>Yep.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5238-0
00:28:36.908 --> 00:28:41.413
<v Brinth, Alette>What are the four or five
generative AI use cases within</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5238-1
00:28:41.413 --> 00:28:44.258
<v Brinth, Alette>this that we could experiment
with?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5255-0
00:28:44.268 --> 00:28:46.894
<v Brinth, Alette>You know, so I think it would
just be interesting to hear your</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5255-1
00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:48.478
<v Brinth, Alette>perspective on that, cuz
acknowledge.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5306-0
00:28:48.488 --> 00:28:51.922
<v Brinth, Alette>Sorry this is getting a little
bit philosophical, but</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5306-1
00:28:51.922 --> 00:28:55.866
<v Brinth, Alette>acknowledging that experiment is
likely to fail, then you can</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5306-2
00:28:55.866 --> 00:28:59.555
<v Brinth, Alette>pivot quite quickly if you if
you know what your use case</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5306-3
00:28:59.555 --> 00:29:01.908
<v Brinth, Alette>trajectory, so to speak is you
know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5328-0
00:29:01.918 --> 00:29:04.811
<v Brinth, Alette>So you're saying this is the
process and these are the five</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5328-1
00:29:04.811 --> 00:29:07.608
<v Brinth, Alette>experiments we think we would do
to improve that process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5332-0
00:29:07.698 --> 00:29:08.258
<v Brinth, Alette>This didn't work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5347-0
00:29:08.268 --> 00:29:10.668
<v Brinth, Alette>This didn't work, but this
worked and so you know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5362-0
00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:13.511
<v Brinth, Alette>Then you're building novatron
from another another</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5362-1
00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:14.178
<v Brinth, Alette>perspective.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5364-0
00:29:14.758 --> 00:29:16.168
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, but I think there's a bit
missing.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5368-0
00:29:16.218 --> 00:29:16.588
<v Martin Peck>What?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5394-0
00:29:16.598 --> 00:29:19.435
<v Martin Peck>So I think you need to know the
four or five places you want to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5394-1
00:29:19.435 --> 00:29:22.228
<v Martin Peck>improve before you know the four
or five places you might use.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5438-0
00:29:22.298 --> 00:29:25.019
<v Martin Peck>You may or may not use
generalize, so I think yeah, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5438-1
00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:27.983
<v Martin Peck>need to understand the the user
journey and then you need to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5438-2
00:29:27.983 --> 00:29:30.753
<v Martin Peck>know who and which bits and
understand what it is you're</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5438-3
00:29:30.753 --> 00:29:31.628
<v Martin Peck>trying to improve.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5445-0
00:29:31.638 --> 00:29:33.158
<v Martin Peck>It is the end to end.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5464-0
00:29:35.038 --> 00:29:38.578
<v Martin Peck>Turn around of, you know,
between receiving a question and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5464-1
00:29:38.578 --> 00:29:39.838
<v Martin Peck>giving out an answer.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5492-0
00:29:39.928 --> 00:29:44.406
<v Martin Peck>If it's that end to end time
you're trying to reduce, and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5492-1
00:29:44.406 --> 00:29:49.271
<v Martin Peck>there are four or five places
where time is spent, you need to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5492-2
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:50.738
<v Martin Peck>know you need some.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5523-0
00:29:50.958 --> 00:29:54.008
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, you need to know and and
understand where your time is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5523-1
00:29:54.008 --> 00:29:56.758
<v Martin Peck>spent before you then work out
where the Gen AI is. An</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5523-2
00:29:56.758 --> 00:29:57.358
<v Martin Peck>appropriate.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5528-0
00:29:57.568 --> 00:29:59.788
<v Martin Peck>Umm, picks, flows those things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5540-0
00:30:01.848 --> 00:30:02.198
<v Martin Peck>Alette.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5545-0
00:30:02.018 --> 00:30:02.998
<v Anastasia Collins>They may cause it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5547-0
00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:03.598
<v Anastasia Collins>Sure.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5556-0
00:30:03.828 --> 00:30:05.158
<v Martin Peck>So yeah, sorry on stage you,
sorry.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5552-0
00:30:05.288 --> 00:30:06.398
<v Anastasia Collins>Hey, use me.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5557-0
00:30:06.408 --> 00:30:06.718
<v Anastasia Collins>I'll.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5569-0
00:30:06.728 --> 00:30:09.118
<v Anastasia Collins>I'll like I don't know if that's
helpful as well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5579-0
00:30:09.128 --> 00:30:11.108
<v Anastasia Collins>I know we touched upon that in a
smaller.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5631-0
00:30:11.168 --> 00:30:15.669
<v Anastasia Collins>For a meeting with you, I think
I I would personally perhaps</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5631-1
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:19.875
<v Anastasia Collins>make a suggestion like the the
session that we have, for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5631-2
00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:24.376
<v Anastasia Collins>example with Lauren to complete
and a couple of other people</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5631-3
00:30:24.376 --> 00:30:26.368
<v Anastasia Collins>from the from the R A-Team.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5661-0
00:30:26.378 --> 00:30:31.150
<v Anastasia Collins>I think they have pointed out a
few areas where they see sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5661-1
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.968
<v Anastasia Collins>the I guess the most
significant, the a pain point.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5682-0
00:30:34.978 --> 00:30:38.625
<v Anastasia Collins>So there is where most of the
time is being spent by the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5682-1
00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:40.608
<v Anastasia Collins>representatives of the RA team.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5691-0
00:30:40.618 --> 00:30:43.428
<v Anastasia Collins>For example, one of them
potentially was.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5708-0
00:30:44.358 --> 00:30:48.422
<v Anastasia Collins>You know, people are not very
much willing to put together</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5708-1
00:30:48.422 --> 00:30:51.108
<v Anastasia Collins>that very first draft of the
response.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5720-0
00:30:51.738 --> 00:30:53.668
<v Anastasia Collins>It's not that maybe it takes a
lot of time.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5727-0
00:30:53.678 --> 00:30:54.528
<v Anastasia Collins>It's just nobody.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5754-0
00:30:55.198 --> 00:30:58.858
<v Anastasia Collins>Again, based on what Lauren
said, is nobody's really reeling</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5754-1
00:30:58.858 --> 00:31:02.578
<v Anastasia Collins>probably to go and put that very
first draft because it's not</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5754-2
00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:03.598
<v Anastasia Collins>very interesting.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5757-0
00:31:03.818 --> 00:31:04.858
<v Anastasia Collins>I'm supposed to work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5789-0
00:31:05.188 --> 00:31:08.809
<v Anastasia Collins>Ohh, it's not very exciting
piece of work for for anybody</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5789-1
00:31:08.809 --> 00:31:12.679
<v Anastasia Collins>from our team to do and maybe
it's that area they mentioned a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5789-2
00:31:12.679 --> 00:31:13.678
<v Anastasia Collins>few other areas.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5796-0
00:31:13.688 --> 00:31:15.878
<v Anastasia Collins>So to Martin's point as well, I.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5844-0
00:31:16.428 --> 00:31:20.464
<v Anastasia Collins>Maybe I would have been
recommend sitting down with them</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5844-1
00:31:20.464 --> 00:31:24.571
<v Anastasia Collins>or the people they they end
users who do, who do the work</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5844-2
00:31:24.571 --> 00:31:28.961
<v Anastasia Collins>and identifying some of those
areas based on that mapped sort</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5844-3
00:31:28.961 --> 00:31:33.068
<v Anastasia Collins>of end to end user journey and
then taking it from there.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5847-0
00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:35.618
<v Brinth, Alette>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5868-0
00:31:35.628 --> 00:31:41.350
<v Brinth, Alette>And then and then working with a
with another team to kind of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5868-1
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.088
<v Brinth, Alette>look at.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5872-0
00:31:42.178 --> 00:31:42.808
<v Brinth, Alette>Yeah, I guess.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5879-0
00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:44.098
<v Brinth, Alette>Yeah, that's a really good
suggestion.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5887-0
00:31:44.108 --> 00:31:45.078
<v Brinth, Alette>Thank you very much.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5934-0
00:31:45.488 --> 00:31:49.356
<v Brinth, Alette>And if from those journey, I
guess the ASK is if from those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5934-1
00:31:49.356 --> 00:31:53.224
<v Brinth, Alette>conversations that you were a
part of, there were any other</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5934-2
00:31:53.224 --> 00:31:56.770
<v Brinth, Alette>glaringly obvious experiments
you think would be worth</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5934-3
00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:00.058
<v Brinth, Alette>approaching then please do stick
a sticky on here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5943-0
00:32:00.068 --> 00:32:01.718
<v Brinth, Alette>I think that would be really
valuable for us.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5953-0
00:32:01.728 --> 00:32:02.108
<v Brinth, Alette>Thank you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5970-0
00:32:02.768 --> 00:32:07.647
<v Anastasia Collins>And I think, as Martin said as
well that some of them probably</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/5970-1
00:32:07.647 --> 00:32:10.358
<v Anastasia Collins>could use Gen AI, some some
knots.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6025-0
00:32:10.368 --> 00:32:14.718
<v Anastasia Collins>Again, it seemed that there were
quite a few areas starting at</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6025-1
00:32:14.718 --> 00:32:19.206
<v Anastasia Collins>the beginning of the process of,
for example, focusing on who is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6025-2
00:32:19.206 --> 00:32:23.763
<v Anastasia Collins>picked to response to a specific
question and things like this go</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6025-3
00:32:23.763 --> 00:32:27.768
<v Anastasia Collins>into or all the way to the end
to the end of the process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6042-0
00:32:27.778 --> 00:32:33.038
<v Anastasia Collins>So it may or may not be, may not
be Gen AI solution.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6059-0
00:32:33.048 --> 00:32:34.888
<v Anastasia Collins>I suppose this is what I'm
trying to say as well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6057-0
00:32:35.508 --> 00:32:36.518
<v Brinth, Alette>Yeah, absolutely.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6064-0
00:32:36.528 --> 00:32:37.238
<v Brinth, Alette>I appreciate that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6079-0
00:32:37.248 --> 00:32:39.467
<v Brinth, Alette>And I think there's other teams
looking at automation from a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6079-1
00:32:39.467 --> 00:32:40.268
<v Brinth, Alette>different perspective.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6086-0
00:32:40.278 --> 00:32:41.838
<v Brinth, Alette>So that information is not lost.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6103-0
00:32:41.848 --> 00:32:45.040
<v Brinth, Alette>You know you can send it on to
different teams and and work</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6103-1
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.998
<v Brinth, Alette>together that way.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6108-0
00:32:46.268 --> 00:32:46.908
<v Brinth, Alette>Thank you so much.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6111-0
00:32:49.788 --> 00:32:50.098
<v Martin Peck>Cool.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6113-0
00:32:50.298 --> 00:32:50.708
<v Martin Peck>So yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6125-0
00:32:52.738 --> 00:32:56.168
<v Martin Peck>So I guess I'll leap of faith.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6154-0
00:32:57.068 --> 00:33:02.131
<v Martin Peck>Or yeah, for one of a better
word was to to assume that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6154-1
00:33:02.131 --> 00:33:07.555
<v Martin Peck>somewhere in this journey,
journeys of AI may or may not be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6154-2
00:33:07.555 --> 00:33:08.188
<v Martin Peck>useful.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6201-0
00:33:08.198 --> 00:33:14.359
<v Martin Peck>And so if we if we assume that
it will be what can we do to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6201-1
00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:20.109
<v Martin Peck>sort of prove whether the
current set of large language</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6201-2
00:33:20.109 --> 00:33:26.783
<v Martin Peck>models and embedding models are
capable in any way of parsing or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6201-3
00:33:26.783 --> 00:33:29.658
<v Martin Peck>processing or understanding?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6211-0
00:33:30.068 --> 00:33:32.958
<v Martin Peck>And I use that word entirely
incorrectly.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6247-0
00:33:33.708 --> 00:33:39.378
<v Martin Peck>Your data so we know that
Novartis has a fairly extensive</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6247-1
00:33:39.378 --> 00:33:44.559
<v Martin Peck>sort of uh dataset of historic
questions that health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6247-2
00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:50.718
<v Martin Peck>authorities have asked and the
responses that have been given.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-0
00:33:50.788 --> 00:33:55.120
<v Martin Peck>So we we know that there is a
past 2030 thousand of these</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-1
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.825
<v Martin Peck>questions or or more that are
available to the for some use or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-2
00:33:59.825 --> 00:34:04.530
<v Martin Peck>other like sorry for example we
know somewhere in this process</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-3
00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.712
<v Martin Peck>that if if a question has been
asked before if a health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-4
00:34:08.712 --> 00:34:13.044
<v Martin Peck>authority or a different
authorities asked a very similar</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-5
00:34:13.044 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Martin Peck>question in the past wouldn't it
be useful to know that like</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-6
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.529
<v Martin Peck>wouldn't it be helpful to the to
someone who was trying to answer</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-7
00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:27.234
<v Martin Peck>this question to know actually
this question or something very</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6353-8
00:34:27.234 --> 00:34:29.998
<v Martin Peck>similar to it has been asked in
the.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6361-0
00:34:30.088 --> 00:34:32.698
<v Martin Peck>Past and what was the response?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6409-0
00:34:33.538 --> 00:34:37.677
<v Martin Peck>Because even if if an end user
business user doesn't do</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6409-1
00:34:37.677 --> 00:34:42.481
<v Martin Peck>anything with that, just knowing
that that was the case may well</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6409-2
00:34:42.481 --> 00:34:46.693
<v Martin Peck>help either sort of answer the
question or determine the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6409-3
00:34:46.693 --> 00:34:49.428
<v Martin Peck>strategy for answering the
question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6429-0
00:34:49.438 --> 00:34:54.322
<v Martin Peck>It might be that that question
has been pushed back on, or or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6429-1
00:34:54.322 --> 00:34:56.528
<v Martin Peck>not answered, or so I think.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6435-0
00:34:56.578 --> 00:34:58.848
<v Martin Peck>Centrally, we're talking about
search.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6458-0
00:34:58.858 --> 00:35:03.530
<v Martin Peck>We're talking about the ability
to say, hey, I've got a question</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6458-1
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.478
<v Martin Peck>that's just appeared in my list
of work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6460-0
00:35:06.658 --> 00:35:06.968
<v Martin Peck>Gotta.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6467-0
00:35:07.978 --> 00:35:09.648
<v Martin Peck>I've got this new question too.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6469-0
00:35:09.718 --> 00:35:10.128
<v Martin Peck>Uh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6473-0
00:35:10.138 --> 00:35:10.788
<v Martin Peck>Try and respond to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6492-0
00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:15.398
<v Martin Peck>Are there examples of this
question being asked in the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6492-1
00:35:15.398 --> 00:35:15.598
<v Martin Peck>past?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6522-0
00:35:15.608 --> 00:35:19.653
<v Martin Peck>So that's that's part one of uh
of the sort of leap of faith</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6522-1
00:35:19.653 --> 00:35:23.698
<v Martin Peck>we've made, which is that's
likely to crop up at some point.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6573-0
00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:28.786
<v Martin Peck>So can we in any way prove to
ourselves that this is this is a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6573-1
00:35:28.786 --> 00:35:33.467
<v Martin Peck>problem we can solve, because
questions in fact, if I come</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6573-2
00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:38.704
<v Martin Peck>back to the the wiki, one of the
first questions that we had, uh,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6573-3
00:35:38.704 --> 00:35:43.068
<v Martin Peck>I'm going to struggle to
remember exactly where it is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6578-0
00:35:44.988 --> 00:35:45.478
<v Martin Peck>Uh did.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6584-0
00:35:45.908 --> 00:35:46.968
<v Martin Peck>Maybe it's an exact summary.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6594-0
00:35:47.558 --> 00:35:51.178
<v Martin Peck>Umm, the the questions are not
trivial and I'm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6600-0
00:35:55.978 --> 00:35:56.988
<v Martin Peck>Maybe some of the data?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6606-0
00:36:03.238 --> 00:36:03.988
<v Martin Peck>OK, right.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6612-0
00:36:03.998 --> 00:36:06.238
<v Martin Peck>So this is one example of it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6658-0
00:36:06.508 --> 00:36:11.970
<v Martin Peck>So this chunk of text is a
question is a an example of a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6658-1
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:17.624
<v Martin Peck>question that is that is related
to a particular synthetic</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6658-2
00:36:17.624 --> 00:36:23.470
<v Martin Peck>dossier and hopefully you can
see that this is not a trivial</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6658-3
00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:24.908
<v Martin Peck>thing to pause.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6692-0
00:36:24.968 --> 00:36:29.369
<v Martin Peck>It's in fact, you know, if you
if you were to look at it, there</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6692-1
00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:33.221
<v Martin Peck>aren't actually question marks
at the end of any of the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6692-2
00:36:33.221 --> 00:36:35.078
<v Martin Peck>multiple sentences in here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6711-0
00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:38.494
<v Martin Peck>It's not obvious that this is a
question, but this is asking For</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6711-1
00:36:38.494 --> 00:36:40.418
<v Martin Peck>more information or
clarification around.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6738-0
00:36:41.018 --> 00:36:46.729
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, to clear section of a
document and there's a lot of,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6738-1
00:36:46.729 --> 00:36:51.957
<v Martin Peck>you know, technical words,
references to things, umm,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6738-2
00:36:51.957 --> 00:36:52.828
<v Martin Peck>acronyms.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6771-0
00:36:53.408 --> 00:36:58.655
<v Martin Peck>So our first sort of area of
thought was well, can you know,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6771-1
00:36:58.655 --> 00:37:03.989
<v Martin Peck>is this even something that the
current set of large language</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6771-2
00:37:03.989 --> 00:37:07.258
<v Martin Peck>models can can get any traction
with?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6785-0
00:37:07.268 --> 00:37:10.974
<v Martin Peck>Could we take this sort of
question and find similar ones</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6785-1
00:37:10.974 --> 00:37:11.358
<v Martin Peck>to it?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6800-0
00:37:11.368 --> 00:37:15.171
<v Martin Peck>Because that is quite a lengthy
question, it's quite quite</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6800-1
00:37:15.171 --> 00:37:15.558
<v Martin Peck>dense.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6856-0
00:37:16.948 --> 00:37:21.498
<v Martin Peck>The second part of the Leap of
Faith was well, assuming we do</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6856-1
00:37:21.498 --> 00:37:25.754
<v Martin Peck>that, then well, could an A
large language model use both</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6856-2
00:37:25.754 --> 00:37:29.937
<v Martin Peck>these sort of historic he's
historic questions and their</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6856-3
00:37:29.937 --> 00:37:34.413
<v Martin Peck>associated answers and also the
dossiers that are related to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6856-4
00:37:34.413 --> 00:37:36.468
<v Martin Peck>these questions and answers.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6872-0
00:37:36.478 --> 00:37:41.194
<v Martin Peck>So they multiply the multi page
PDF that are essentially the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6872-1
00:37:41.194 --> 00:37:42.508
<v Martin Peck>drug submissions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6880-0
00:37:42.778 --> 00:37:44.228
<v Martin Peck>Good enough large language
model.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6891-0
00:37:44.458 --> 00:37:49.578
<v Martin Peck>Use this data to begin the job
of drafting a response.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-0
00:37:49.858 --> 00:37:53.538
<v Martin Peck>So not to actually generate a
response that would then be sent</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-1
00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:56.927
<v Martin Peck>without, you know, human
involvement, but certainly could</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-2
00:37:56.927 --> 00:38:00.315
<v Martin Peck>it begin to suggest potential
responses and and sort of I</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-3
00:38:00.315 --> 00:38:03.879
<v Martin Peck>guess sort of you know, remove
that problem where you have a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-4
00:38:03.879 --> 00:38:07.442
<v Martin Peck>sort of you know blank sheet of
paper and you know you don't</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-5
00:38:07.442 --> 00:38:11.123
<v Martin Peck>know what to you know where to
start and give some suggestions</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6968-6
00:38:11.123 --> 00:38:11.298
<v Martin Peck>on.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/6976-0
00:38:11.468 --> 00:38:14.418
<v Martin Peck>Well, these are potential
responses to this question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-0
00:38:14.848 --> 00:38:18.668
<v Martin Peck>So those two we you know we made
assumption that searching for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-1
00:38:18.668 --> 00:38:22.488
<v Martin Peck>and finding similar questions
was gonna be one thing we likely</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-2
00:38:22.488 --> 00:38:26.247
<v Martin Peck>to need to do and prove that
it's it's possible to do and the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-3
00:38:26.247 --> 00:38:30.188
<v Martin Peck>other is pausing and processing
these these these dossiers to be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-4
00:38:30.188 --> 00:38:34.190
<v Martin Peck>able to sort of maybe respond to
these questions was another area</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-5
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:37.707
<v Martin Peck>that a large lag which model
might be useful for and that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-6
00:38:37.707 --> 00:38:41.103
<v Martin Peck>that this would be generally
useful for the the overall</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7070-7
00:38:41.103 --> 00:38:41.588
<v Martin Peck>process.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7073-0
00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.348
<v Martin Peck>I'm so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7094-0
00:38:49.328 --> 00:38:53.984
<v Martin Peck>That's essentially the the very
sort of high level problem that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7094-1
00:38:53.984 --> 00:38:55.658
<v Martin Peck>we are trying to solve.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7120-0
00:38:55.668 --> 00:39:00.252
<v Martin Peck>And if I come back or problems
that we've been sort of looking</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7120-1
00:39:00.252 --> 00:39:04.836
<v Martin Peck>at and essentially and we talk
about the experiments later, we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7120-2
00:39:04.836 --> 00:39:05.418
<v Martin Peck>just go.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7139-0
00:39:09.278 --> 00:39:13.093
<v Martin Peck>We we have had but the backlog
is probably a better place to to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7139-1
00:39:13.093 --> 00:39:13.868
<v Martin Peck>look at this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7158-0
00:39:21.368 --> 00:39:24.718
<v Martin Peck>This concept of I'll come back
to that experiment.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7164-0
00:39:24.728 --> 00:39:26.308
<v Martin Peck>One is but experiment two and
experiment three.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7205-0
00:39:26.318 --> 00:39:30.994
<v Martin Peck>Experiment two is is essentially
around, you know, answering that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7205-1
00:39:30.994 --> 00:39:35.316
<v Martin Peck>first or trying to gather some
data that helps us answer the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7205-2
00:39:35.316 --> 00:39:39.637
<v Martin Peck>first question, which is can we
take a new question and find</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7205-3
00:39:39.637 --> 00:39:42.188
<v Martin Peck>similar questions to that
question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-0
00:39:42.238 --> 00:39:47.314
<v Martin Peck>So can we go and find related
relevant historic health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-1
00:39:47.314 --> 00:39:52.944
<v Martin Peck>authority questions and their
answers given a a new or novel</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-2
00:39:52.944 --> 00:39:58.297
<v Martin Peck>question that is essentially
experiment to in a nutshell,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-3
00:39:58.297 --> 00:40:03.927
<v Martin Peck>experiment three is can we then
take the the vast amount now</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-4
00:40:03.927 --> 00:40:09.557
<v Martin Peck>counts of dossiers and they're
sort of large amounts of, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-5
00:40:09.557 --> 00:40:14.633
<v Martin Peck>know, each of the each of the
dossiers around the drug</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-6
00:40:14.633 --> 00:40:20.632
<v Martin Peck>submission is 10s or hundreds of
pages long with a lot of deeply</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-7
00:40:20.632 --> 00:40:25.801
<v Martin Peck>scientific technical data,
tables, images take all that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-8
00:40:25.801 --> 00:40:31.338
<v Martin Peck>stuff and use that to help
respond in some way to questions</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7315-9
00:40:31.338 --> 00:40:33.738
<v Martin Peck>around the questions that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7319-0
00:40:33.788 --> 00:40:34.998
<v Martin Peck>OK, posed.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7325-0
00:40:35.998 --> 00:40:36.968
<v Martin Peck>And that's experiment 3.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7360-0
00:40:38.718 --> 00:40:42.818
<v Martin Peck>The spoilers here is that we we
received data to help us and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7360-1
00:40:42.818 --> 00:40:47.053
<v Martin Peck>start to look at experiment two
around December and we haven't</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7360-2
00:40:47.053 --> 00:40:50.548
<v Martin Peck>yet received data to help us
with experiment three.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7396-0
00:40:50.558 --> 00:40:54.173
<v Martin Peck>So I'm likely to spend much more
time talking about experiment</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7396-1
00:40:54.173 --> 00:40:57.845
<v Martin Peck>too, because from sort of like
mid December onwards we had some</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7396-2
00:40:57.845 --> 00:40:59.968
<v Martin Peck>Excel sheets that sort of helped
us.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7414-0
00:41:00.388 --> 00:41:04.735
<v Martin Peck>Umm, before you know, start to
look at this work we have I</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7414-1
00:41:04.735 --> 00:41:05.988
<v Martin Peck>guess spent well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7451-0
00:41:06.198 --> 00:41:10.052
<v Martin Peck>We spent way less time on
experiment 3 because we haven't</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7451-1
00:41:10.052 --> 00:41:14.039
<v Martin Peck>had data to to work on it, but
we can sort of talk about we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7451-2
00:41:14.039 --> 00:41:17.428
<v Martin Peck>talk a little bit about
experiment three later on.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7487-0
00:41:18.318 --> 00:41:23.522
<v Martin Peck>So experiment one really sort of
was a precursor or sort of, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7487-1
00:41:23.522 --> 00:41:27.604
<v Martin Peck>know, helps us sort of
understand the scope of the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7487-2
00:41:27.604 --> 00:41:32.328
<v Martin Peck>problem, which was that we were
given a synthetic dossier.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7542-0
00:41:33.888 --> 00:41:37.874
<v Martin Peck>I am sorry I a subset of a
synthetic dossier, some</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7542-1
00:41:37.874 --> 00:41:42.563
<v Martin Peck>particular sections from a
synthetic dossier which sits out</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7542-2
00:41:42.563 --> 00:41:47.409
<v Martin Peck>there on the Internet and we
were able to sort of take a look</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7542-3
00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:52.098
<v Martin Peck>at and get some initial sort of
thoughts and views on that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7554-0
00:41:52.108 --> 00:41:54.708
<v Martin Peck>So experiment one was really, I
guess, sort of.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7568-0
00:41:56.438 --> 00:42:03.768
<v Martin Peck>I the sort of very basic first
pass at can we?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7575-0
00:42:05.248 --> 00:42:06.258
<v Martin Peck>What can we do with?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7643-0
00:42:06.268 --> 00:42:10.652
<v Martin Peck>You know, we we have a better
understand what that, you know,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7643-1
00:42:10.652 --> 00:42:15.106
<v Martin Peck>these dossiers will look like
when we have to get them is what</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7643-2
00:42:15.106 --> 00:42:19.278
<v Martin Peck>can we do in terms of breaking
these documents up and then</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7643-3
00:42:19.278 --> 00:42:23.662
<v Martin Peck>answering asking questions of
them or asking using generative</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7643-4
00:42:23.662 --> 00:42:27.551
<v Martin Peck>AI and and search indexes to
sort of interrogate these</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7643-5
00:42:27.551 --> 00:42:28.258
<v Martin Peck>documents.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7649-0
00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:31.328
<v Martin Peck>Excuse me.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7661-0
00:42:31.338 --> 00:42:35.596
<v Martin Peck>I'm just gonna, uh, drink some
coffee because my throat is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7661-1
00:42:35.596 --> 00:42:36.318
<v Martin Peck>giving up.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7664-0
00:42:45.418 --> 00:42:47.038
<v Martin Peck>OK so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7696-0
00:42:51.918 --> 00:42:55.958
<v Martin Peck>Talked about the the various
assets we've got the user</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7696-1
00:42:55.958 --> 00:43:00.440
<v Martin Peck>journey mapping I've I've shown
and sort of talked about the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7696-2
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:01.248
<v Martin Peck>high level.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7715-0
00:43:02.118 --> 00:43:04.491
<v Martin Peck>I guess the goal that we're
trying to achieve here which is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7715-1
00:43:04.491 --> 00:43:05.678
<v Martin Peck>you know there are two things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7755-0
00:43:05.688 --> 00:43:10.667
<v Martin Peck>One is searching for and finding
relevant stuff, and the second</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7755-1
00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:15.335
<v Martin Peck>one is and then having searched
for and found some relevant</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7755-2
00:43:15.335 --> 00:43:20.158
<v Martin Peck>stuff going deeper into that
that data retrieving things from</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7755-3
00:43:20.158 --> 00:43:24.048
<v Martin Peck>dossiers and and helping to
respond to questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7773-0
00:43:26.448 --> 00:43:30.955
<v Martin Peck>I'm going to move on to two
things now, RAG and the ECN</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7773-1
00:43:30.955 --> 00:43:31.358
<v Martin Peck>demo.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7782-0
00:43:32.188 --> 00:43:34.698
<v Martin Peck>I'm just gonna talk about RAG in
general.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7806-0
00:43:34.708 --> 00:43:38.832
<v Martin Peck>It's the concept and then show
the ECN demo which is I guess an</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7806-1
00:43:38.832 --> 00:43:40.508
<v Martin Peck>implementation of of that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7816-0
00:43:40.868 --> 00:43:44.648
<v Martin Peck>Anybody any questions before we
move on?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7829-0
00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:54.027
<v Martin Peck>Anybody from the Microsoft team
think I've missed anything so</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7829-1
00:43:54.027 --> 00:43:54.208
<v Martin Peck>far?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7835-0
00:43:58.578 --> 00:43:58.848
<v David Moore>Thanks.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7859-0
00:43:58.858 --> 00:44:03.261
<v David Moore>It's making sense to me, but and
if anyone from give out to one</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7848-0
00:43:59.938 --> 00:44:00.998
<v Anastasia Collins>Nothing. Mm-hmm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7859-1
00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:05.738
<v David Moore>minute for anyone from Novartis
to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7866-0
00:44:07.948 --> 00:44:08.938
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>No, we are good.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7879-0
00:44:08.528 --> 00:44:09.088
<v David Moore>Asking.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7878-0
00:44:09.448 --> 00:44:11.038
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>Please jump into the rack, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7881-0
00:44:11.378 --> 00:44:12.208
<v Martin Peck>Oh, OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7885-0
00:44:12.258 --> 00:44:12.908
<v Martin Peck>Right.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7889-0
00:44:12.968 --> 00:44:13.138
<v David Moore>So.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7891-0
00:44:13.078 --> 00:44:14.448
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna try this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7901-0
00:44:14.458 --> 00:44:16.738
<v Martin Peck>Is this is, I'm gonna try and do
a demo.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7917-0
00:44:17.298 --> 00:44:21.028
<v Martin Peck>This is almost certainly gonna
wrong, so bear with me.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7924-0
00:44:21.418 --> 00:44:23.928
<v Martin Peck>So large language models.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7995-0
00:44:25.988 --> 00:44:31.321
<v Martin Peck>I mean, if you go and you know,
search for RAG and and go and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7995-1
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:36.568
<v Martin Peck>watch some videos go and watch
some tutorials on what RAG is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7995-2
00:44:36.568 --> 00:44:41.987
<v Martin Peck>and what it does, it's a, excuse
me, it is a a technique which</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7995-3
00:44:41.987 --> 00:44:46.804
<v Martin Peck>allows you to umm, there's
actually feeds data to allow</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7995-4
00:44:46.804 --> 00:44:52.138
<v Martin Peck>large language models so that it
can do something useful with</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/7995-5
00:44:52.138 --> 00:44:52.998
<v Martin Peck>that data.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8012-0
00:44:53.188 --> 00:44:58.378
<v Martin Peck>So I have a a very simple as
you're.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8021-0
00:44:58.418 --> 00:45:00.288
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna bump up fonts up a
little bit here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8033-0
00:45:00.298 --> 00:45:01.488
<v Martin Peck>So you can just see what's going
on.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8058-0
00:45:01.558 --> 00:45:04.842
<v Martin Peck>A little very simple, as you're
sort of, I said it was your</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8058-1
00:45:04.842 --> 00:45:07.688
<v Martin Peck>resources that I've deployed
into a resource group.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8073-0
00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:13.370
<v Martin Peck>I've deployed a storage account
which is just somewhere to put</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8073-1
00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:13.838
<v Martin Peck>files.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8086-0
00:45:14.028 --> 00:45:17.938
<v Martin Peck>I've deployed an instance of
Azure Open AI which is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8128-0
00:45:18.508 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Martin Peck>I'll show you a minute, but
essentially that's where I can</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8128-1
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.618
<v Martin Peck>then deploy my GPT for model,
and that's essentially provides</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8128-2
00:45:27.618 --> 00:45:32.136
<v Martin Peck>me an API, an endpoint, and for
or interrogating that large</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8128-3
00:45:32.136 --> 00:45:35.148
<v Martin Peck>language model and asking it
questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8154-0
00:45:35.158 --> 00:45:38.444
<v Martin Peck>Having that sort of chat
experience, and I've deployed</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8154-1
00:45:38.444 --> 00:45:42.088
<v Martin Peck>and you'll see why in a minute,
a search service next to it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8194-0
00:45:42.098 --> 00:45:46.884
<v Martin Peck>So this is essentially I I you
know, like any sort of that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8194-1
00:45:46.884 --> 00:45:51.264
<v Martin Peck>search services allows me to
index documents and then</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8194-2
00:45:51.264 --> 00:45:56.618
<v Martin Peck>provides an API to to query that
index and to retrieve documents.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8208-0
00:45:59.068 --> 00:46:02.493
<v Martin Peck>And so I'm gonna quickly just
jump into my open AI endpoints</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8208-1
00:46:02.493 --> 00:46:02.998
<v Martin Peck>and open.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8227-0
00:46:05.448 --> 00:46:08.420
<v Martin Peck>And hope that whatever that is
saying isn't gonna trip me up in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8227-1
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:08.838
<v Martin Peck>a minute.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8229-0
00:46:09.088 --> 00:46:09.668
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, brilliant.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8233-0
00:46:14.778 --> 00:46:15.278
<v Martin Peck>You know, open.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8241-0
00:46:17.788 --> 00:46:19.268
<v Martin Peck>AI Studio, which is a.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8248-0
00:46:23.778 --> 00:46:24.318
<v Martin Peck>Yes, come on.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8252-0
00:46:24.328 --> 00:46:25.528
<v Martin Peck>Demo Gods, you can do it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8256-0
00:46:32.688 --> 00:46:34.998
<v Martin Peck>OK, cool.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8259-0
00:46:36.298 --> 00:46:37.018
<v Martin Peck>Which is a.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8285-0
00:46:39.508 --> 00:46:45.055
<v Martin Peck>Uh, sort of tools success on top
of the Azure open AI deployment</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8285-1
00:46:45.055 --> 00:46:47.018
<v Martin Peck>that lets you do stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8303-0
00:46:47.068 --> 00:46:52.569
<v Martin Peck>So one of them is, uh, this chat
playground where essentially if</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8303-1
00:46:52.569 --> 00:46:54.008
<v Martin Peck>you've used Bing.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8320-0
00:46:56.328 --> 00:47:01.868
<v Martin Peck>How you used any sort of the
open AI chat experiences?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8336-0
00:47:02.298 --> 00:47:06.828
<v Martin Peck>It's basically that so I am now
in the in the center here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8344-0
00:47:06.838 --> 00:47:09.758
<v Martin Peck>I have my chat window on the
left.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8387-0
00:47:09.768 --> 00:47:14.057
<v Martin Peck>Here I have some setup, some
prompts that I can use to sort</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8387-1
00:47:14.057 --> 00:47:18.562
<v Martin Peck>of I guess direct my interaction
with the the the model so you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8387-2
00:47:18.562 --> 00:47:22.923
<v Martin Peck>can see here there's a system
message says that you're an AI</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8387-3
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:23.638
<v Martin Peck>assistant.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8396-0
00:47:23.648 --> 00:47:25.138
<v Martin Peck>That helps people find
information.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8444-0
00:47:25.948 --> 00:47:30.171
<v Martin Peck>I can add this, I can change
this to be something else and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8444-1
00:47:30.171 --> 00:47:34.537
<v Martin Peck>essentially when I chat with
this large language model, this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8444-2
00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:38.545
<v Martin Peck>information is going to be
passed to it so that it then</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8444-3
00:47:38.545 --> 00:47:42.839
<v Martin Peck>responds in a particular way,
and commonly you might change</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8444-4
00:47:42.839 --> 00:47:44.128
<v Martin Peck>these messages to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8489-0
00:47:44.698 --> 00:47:48.367
<v Martin Peck>So why the tell it to, you know,
to be very clear on what it's</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8489-1
00:47:48.367 --> 00:47:52.036
<v Martin Peck>responding to or just give it
some instructions and guide some</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8489-2
00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:55.705
<v Martin Peck>guardrails around how you want
this interaction to take place,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8489-3
00:47:55.705 --> 00:47:57.278
<v Martin Peck>how you want it to proceed.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8498-0
00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:00.768

<v Martin Peck>That's the joke I told me last
time when I was doing this demo</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8573-1
00:48:25.021 --> 00:48:25.668

<v Martin Peck>Don't know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8716-0
00:49:30.388 --> 00:49:33.618
<v Martin Peck>I'm talking about and this is
where RAG comes in.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8745-0
00:49:33.628 --> 00:49:39.014
<v Martin Peck>So RAG is our ability to sort of
or the process of linking up</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8745-1
00:49:39.014 --> 00:49:44.486
<v Martin Peck>generative AI and large language
models with search and search</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8745-2
00:49:44.486 --> 00:49:46.658
<v Martin Peck>indexes and data sources.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8765-0
00:49:46.908 --> 00:49:51.980
<v Martin Peck>So one of the things I can do
here is I can add a data source</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8765-1
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.798
<v Martin Peck>into this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8787-0
00:49:52.808 --> 00:49:57.636
<v Martin Peck>Now this I'll quickly do it
takes a couple of minutes for it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8787-1
00:49:57.636 --> 00:49:59.378
<v Martin Peck>to to work, but I can.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8795-0
00:50:00.438 --> 00:50:01.668
<v Martin Peck>So I want to upload some files.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8808-0
00:50:01.678 --> 00:50:05.138
<v Martin Peck>I'm just gonna sort of use the
file upload option here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8822-0
00:50:05.148 --> 00:50:07.733
<v Martin Peck>There are various other data
sources I could be pointing this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8822-1
00:50:07.733 --> 00:50:08.108
<v Martin Peck>thing at.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8872-0
00:50:09.158 --> 00:50:13.139
<v Martin Peck>I'm going to pick a storage
account that I that I showed you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8872-1
00:50:13.139 --> 00:50:17.185
<v Martin Peck>a minute ago and I'm going to
pick the search index or search</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8872-2
00:50:17.185 --> 00:50:20.970
<v Martin Peck>service that I mentioned a
moment ago, and then I'm gonna</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8872-3
00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.798
<v Martin Peck>give this a index of impact.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8888-0
00:50:22.808 --> 00:50:26.803
<v Martin Peck>Uh Demo 03, and you can probably
get some many times I've</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8888-1
00:50:26.803 --> 00:50:28.318
<v Martin Peck>practice this morning.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8900-0
00:50:28.688 --> 00:50:30.878
<v Martin Peck>I'm just gonna click a few
things here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8906-0
00:50:30.928 --> 00:50:33.028
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna pick an embedding
model.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8909-0
00:50:33.088 --> 00:50:33.478
<v Martin Peck>Ohh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8923-0
00:50:35.678 --> 00:50:40.128
<v Martin Peck>Next, OK, and now it allows me
to upload some files.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8943-0
00:50:40.138 --> 00:50:44.386
<v Martin Peck>So I'm just going to get rid of
that text document I have here</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8943-1
00:50:44.386 --> 00:50:45.398
<v Martin Peck>this text file.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8973-0
00:50:46.448 --> 00:50:50.628
<v Martin Peck>The secret word is cheese and
this document here the magic</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8973-1
00:50:50.628 --> 00:50:54.595
<v Martin Peck>crazes and then just some
rubbish and I'm going to grab</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8973-2
00:50:54.595 --> 00:50:57.358
<v Martin Peck>these two files and drop them in
here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8982-0
00:50:57.828 --> 00:51:01.438
<v Martin Peck>Upload those files and then
talk.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8994-0
00:51:01.508 --> 00:51:06.028
<v Martin Peck>While this does its job and let
me just check that's uploaded.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/8996-0
00:51:08.338 --> 00:51:08.578
<v Martin Peck>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9001-0
00:51:11.878 --> 00:51:12.408
<v Martin Peck>Click click.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9005-0
00:51:12.418 --> 00:51:14.228
<v Martin Peck>Click OK then close.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9059-0
00:51:18.718 --> 00:51:23.298
<v Martin Peck>What this then does in the
background is takes those two</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9059-1
00:51:23.298 --> 00:51:28.521
<v Martin Peck>documents, indexes them for exit
beddings of those uh documents,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9059-2
00:51:28.521 --> 00:51:33.100
<v Martin Peck>indexes, then makes them
available to the search service</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9059-3
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:37.921
<v Martin Peck>that I've deployed, and then
also makes that search service</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9059-4
00:51:37.921 --> 00:51:39.368
<v Martin Peck>available to this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9074-0
00:51:39.798 --> 00:51:44.316
<v Martin Peck>This chat experience now likely
is likelihood is that this will</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9074-1
00:51:44.316 --> 00:51:45.728
<v Martin Peck>not work first time.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9083-0
00:51:45.738 --> 00:51:51.648
<v Martin Peck>So what is the no secret word?
Uh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9103-0
00:51:56.858 --> 00:52:01.012
<v Martin Peck>OK, so it's still hasn't yet
indexed those, but if I continue</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9103-1
00:52:01.012 --> 00:52:02.218
<v Martin Peck>to ask, hopefully.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9108-0
00:52:10.408 --> 00:52:11.128
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9166-0
00:52:11.138 --> 00:52:16.205
<v Martin Peck>OK, we'll give it a couple of
minutes, but the concept I'm</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9166-1
00:52:16.205 --> 00:52:21.272
<v Martin Peck>trying to show here is that we
are adding this, we will be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9166-2
00:52:21.272 --> 00:52:26.340
<v Martin Peck>adding additional data sources
that the the large language</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9166-3
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:31.321
<v Martin Peck>model can then access and by
doing that it's it gives the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9166-4
00:52:31.321 --> 00:52:35.358
<v Martin Peck>impression that the the service
has knowledge.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9197-0
00:52:35.488 --> 00:52:38.007
<v Martin Peck>You know that we've, we've
trained is the wrong is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9197-1
00:52:38.007 --> 00:52:40.823
<v Martin Peck>absolutely the wrong word, but
it looks like it has been</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9197-2
00:52:40.823 --> 00:52:43.738
<v Martin Peck>trained to understand more
things than it knew previously.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9202-0
00:52:44.168 --> 00:52:45.048
<v Martin Peck>We'll try one more time.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9208-0
00:52:59.978 --> 00:53:00.328
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9212-0
00:53:00.338 --> 00:53:01.168
<v Martin Peck>OK, alright.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9274-0
00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:05.298
<v Martin Peck>Well, as all demos are destined
to fail when shown to other</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9274-1
00:53:05.298 --> 00:53:09.282
<v Martin Peck>people, and this is probably,
you know, this is fine, but</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9274-2
00:53:09.282 --> 00:53:13.471
<v Martin Peck>essentially hopefully you get
the idea of what should happen</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9274-3
00:53:13.471 --> 00:53:17.385
<v Martin Peck>and what was happening in
previous instances is that you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9274-4
00:53:17.385 --> 00:53:21.712
<v Martin Peck>get, you know you get the the
response basically sort of tells</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9274-5
00:53:21.712 --> 00:53:21.918
<v Martin Peck>me.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9283-0
00:53:24.128 --> 00:53:25.788
<v Martin Peck>Let me just check what it says.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9285-0
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:28.328
<v Martin Peck>That's interesting.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9315-0
00:53:28.338 --> 00:53:32.064
<v Martin Peck>I think the screen refresh that
I saw earlier actually ended up</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9315-1
00:53:32.064 --> 00:53:35.848
<v Martin Peck>sort of removing my data source,
so that's why it's not working.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9342-0
00:53:36.298 --> 00:53:39.919
<v Martin Peck>I think we might have some
connectivity issues between my</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9342-1
00:53:39.919 --> 00:53:43.789
<v Martin Peck>cloud PC and, but anyway, yeah,
so this is not this should be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9342-2
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:45.288
<v Martin Peck>showing the data source.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9356-0
00:53:45.438 --> 00:53:49.368
<v Martin Peck>I won't look setting up again,
but take it as read.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9369-0
00:53:49.418 --> 00:53:51.878
<v Martin Peck>What you would see is it would
it would.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9376-0
00:53:51.888 --> 00:53:53.088
<v Martin Peck>It would give me those answers.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9387-0
00:53:53.098 --> 00:53:55.008
<v Martin Peck>It would tell me that the secret
word is cheese.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9421-0
00:53:55.018 --> 00:53:58.637
<v Martin Peck>The magic phrase is that you
know random sort of characters,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9421-1
00:53:58.637 --> 00:54:02.019
<v Martin Peck>but it was also give me a
reference so it would then say</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9421-2
00:54:02.019 --> 00:54:04.748
<v Martin Peck>and I found this in this
particular location.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9425-0
00:54:05.378 --> 00:54:06.198
<v Martin Peck>And that's RAG.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9449-0
00:54:06.248 --> 00:54:11.682
<v Martin Peck>That is essentially the process
that we are trying to use here,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9449-1
00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:15.418
<v Martin Peck>because then we can say, you
know, can you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9463-0
00:54:15.468 --> 00:54:18.357
<v Martin Peck>I've been given a health
authority question that is blah</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9463-1
00:54:18.357 --> 00:54:19.118
<v Martin Peck>blah blah blah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9469-0
00:54:19.188 --> 00:54:20.378
<v Martin Peck>Can you find me similar?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9524-0
00:54:20.948 --> 00:54:23.775
<v Martin Peck>Can you either you know,
summarize this question or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9524-1
00:54:23.775 --> 00:54:27.092
<v Martin Peck>summarizing questions and sort
of like picking out data from</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9524-2
00:54:27.092 --> 00:54:30.518
<v Martin Peck>the question is something that
large language model is capable</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9524-3
00:54:30.518 --> 00:54:33.346
<v Martin Peck>of doing it because it
understands the structure of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9524-4
00:54:33.346 --> 00:54:36.608
<v Martin Peck>language and it knows how to
sort of formulate responses to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9524-5
00:54:36.608 --> 00:54:37.968
<v Martin Peck>those sorts of questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9540-0
00:54:37.978 --> 00:54:41.268
<v Martin Peck>But if we then say can you know,
is this similar to?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9572-0
00:54:41.338 --> 00:54:46.501
<v Martin Peck>You know other questions or how
would you respond that that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9572-1
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:50.890
<v Martin Peck>search index and those
additional data sources are</v>

00:54:50.890 --> 00:54:55.967
<v Martin Peck>where the are used to then help
formulate answers to those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9572-3
00:54:55.967 --> 00:54:56.828
<v Martin Peck>questions?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9579-0
00:54:57.578 --> 00:54:57.858
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9609-0
00:54:57.868 --> 00:55:02.233
<v Martin Peck>Sorry, that didn't work the and
so that's like, you know if you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9609-1
00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:06.394
<v Martin Peck>wanted to go ahead and you could
play with this yourself, do</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9609-2
00:55:06.394 --> 00:55:08.918
<v Martin Peck>exactly the same thing as I've
done.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9650-0
00:55:08.928 --> 00:55:12.935
<v Martin Peck>Hopefully see a better response
because you wouldn't have seen a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9650-1
00:55:12.935 --> 00:55:16.510
<v Martin Peck>connectivity issue halfway
through your demo and you'd be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9650-2
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:19.408
<v Martin Peck>able to interrogate documents as
you see here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9670-0
00:55:19.418 --> 00:55:24.045
<v Martin Peck>If you're playing with Azure,
then you can point it at storage</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9670-1
00:55:24.045 --> 00:55:26.028
<v Martin Peck>containers or or cosmos DB.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9681-0
00:55:26.038 --> 00:55:28.218
<v Martin Peck>You can point it at other
endpoints.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9697-0
00:55:28.228 --> 00:55:32.399
<v Martin Peck>You can ask it to sort of go and
consume data from some other</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9697-1
00:55:32.399 --> 00:55:32.668
<v Martin Peck>URL.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9718-0
00:55:33.118 --> 00:55:35.358
<v Martin Peck>I was using the upload files
option here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9726-0
00:55:37.068 --> 00:55:41.514
<v Martin Peck>The ECN demo that we did was
essentially a much sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9726-1
00:55:41.514 --> 00:55:43.738
<v Martin Peck>fancier, uh version of that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9747-0
00:55:43.748 --> 00:55:48.314
<v Martin Peck>So to try and sort of explain
and show this concept to sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9747-1
00:55:48.314 --> 00:55:50.488
<v Martin Peck>artisan to execs, we use this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9758-0
00:55:52.608 --> 00:55:56.938
<v Martin Peck>Open source demo of A of exactly
that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9773-0
00:55:56.948 --> 00:55:59.741
<v Martin Peck>So this is a an Azure sample
called chat with your data</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9773-1
00:55:59.741 --> 00:56:00.788
<v Martin Peck>solution accelerator.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9779-0
00:56:01.748 --> 00:56:05.888
<v Martin Peck>It's a number of services that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9806-0
00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:13.041
<v Martin Peck>Essentially, our connected
together and socially files come</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9806-1
00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:16.148
<v Martin Peck>into the I I dropped into a
storage account.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9822-0
00:56:16.858 --> 00:56:21.671
<v Martin Peck>Something spots those files have
been added and then indexes</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9822-1
00:56:21.671 --> 00:56:22.618
<v Martin Peck>those files.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9857-0
00:56:22.628 --> 00:56:27.951
<v Martin Peck>So correct me uploads those
files into the search index so</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9857-1
00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:33.093
<v Martin Peck>that a chat front end can be
used to ask questions about</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9857-2
00:56:33.093 --> 00:56:35.078
<v Martin Peck>those those documents.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9864-0
00:56:35.688 --> 00:56:38.198
<v Martin Peck>I have that here again, sorry.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9871-0
00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:40.098
<v Martin Peck>To come back to the wiki just
momentarily.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9890-0
00:56:45.828 --> 00:56:49.230
<v Martin Peck>This will become very already
boring if the PC isn't gonna</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9890-1
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:50.268
<v Martin Peck>connect to things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9908-0
00:57:09.138 --> 00:57:13.038
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, we don't get very far from
connectivity from here is dead.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9917-0
00:57:15.768 --> 00:57:16.788
<v Martin Peck>I'm just going to check
something.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9925-0
00:57:16.798 --> 00:57:18.098
<v Martin Peck>I mean, it's not my
connectivity.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9929-0
00:57:18.108 --> 00:57:19.178
<v Martin Peck>You can hear me, right?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9932-0
00:57:19.608 --> 00:57:19.978
<v Martin Peck>I'm not.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9944-0
00:57:20.028 --> 00:57:20.698
<v Martin Peck>I'm been speaking.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9963-0
00:57:20.218 --> 00:57:24.153
<v Anastasia Collins>Martin, I have similar issues by
the way with connectivity to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9963-1
00:57:24.153 --> 00:57:27.708
<v Anastasia Collins>cloud PC, so you're not the only
one experiencing that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9973-0
00:57:27.818 --> 00:57:28.558
<v Anastasia Collins>Just letting you know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9972-0
00:57:28.108 --> 00:57:28.428
<v Martin Peck>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9974-0
00:57:28.988 --> 00:57:29.538
<v Ashitosh Jedhe>Yeah, me too.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9978-0
00:57:33.238 --> 00:57:35.388
<v Martin Peck>OK, right.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/9990-0
00:57:35.468 --> 00:57:39.168
<v Martin Peck>So with that, so I can't go
there.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10005-0
00:57:39.178 --> 00:57:41.721
<v Martin Peck>But hopefully this will continue
to work because this is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10005-1
00:57:41.721 --> 00:57:42.658
<v Martin Peck>deployed, so this is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10015-0
00:57:44.848 --> 00:57:45.948
<v Martin Peck>Let me show you the other way
around.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10030-0
00:57:45.958 --> 00:57:52.310
<v Martin Peck>So this is a this is the
deployment of this solution</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10030-1
00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:53.748
<v Martin Peck>accelerator.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10036-0
00:57:54.598 --> 00:57:56.168
<v Martin Peck>There are two parts to it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10062-0
00:57:56.178 --> 00:57:59.388
<v Martin Peck>There is a a front end that
allows you to chat and there's a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10062-1
00:57:59.388 --> 00:58:01.598
<v Martin Peck>back end that allows you to
configure it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10072-0
00:58:04.228 --> 00:58:06.888
<v Martin Peck>The links to these are in.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10082-0
00:58:10.488 --> 00:58:11.508
<v Martin Peck>I wonder if this is awesome.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10104-0
00:58:14.008 --> 00:58:18.178
<v Martin Peck>It seems to be OK OK, the links
to these things are in the wiki.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10161-0
00:58:19.128 --> 00:58:22.541
<v Martin Peck>Obviously I can't show you the
wiki at the moment, but</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10161-1
00:58:22.541 --> 00:58:26.513
<v Martin Peck>essentially this allows you to
do what I was trying to do in in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10161-2
00:58:26.513 --> 00:58:30.113
<v Martin Peck>Azure a minute ago, which is to
ingest the data to upload</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10161-3
00:58:30.113 --> 00:58:33.713
<v Martin Peck>additional documents to then
view the documents that have</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10161-4
00:58:33.713 --> 00:58:36.568
<v Martin Peck>been uploaded and you can see
here there are.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10183-0
00:58:37.858 --> 00:58:42.704
<v Martin Peck>It's a number of or it's it's a
half a dozen or so PDF's which</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10183-1
00:58:42.704 --> 00:58:45.628
<v Martin Peck>are uploaded into into this back
end.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10199-0
00:58:47.898 --> 00:58:53.958
<v Martin Peck>And also allows you to configure
the the prompts and this is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10217-0
00:58:54.968 --> 00:58:57.251
<v Martin Peck>That's a much more sort of
comprehensive version of the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10217-1
00:58:57.251 --> 00:58:58.638
<v Martin Peck>thing I was showing a minute
ago.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10219-0
00:58:58.788 --> 00:58:59.198
<v Martin Peck>Where?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10233-0
00:58:59.888 --> 00:59:06.558
<v Martin Peck>Umm, every time you chat with
this this this interface.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10271-0
00:59:06.958 --> 00:59:11.782
<v Martin Peck>Essentially, your chat is being
your your your words you've</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10271-1
00:59:11.782 --> 00:59:16.766
<v Martin Peck>typed have been placed into the
context of this prompt, which</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10271-2
00:59:16.766 --> 00:59:21.590
<v Martin Peck>allows us to, umm, you know,
instruct the the LM to respond</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10271-3
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:23.198
<v Martin Peck>in a particular way.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10297-0
00:59:25.488 --> 00:59:28.670
<v Martin Peck>Always include sources when it's
responding, so always sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10297-1
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:31.498
<v Martin Peck>reference you know where it's
got the information from.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10315-0
00:59:32.008 --> 00:59:36.785
<v Martin Peck>To be very clear, if you can't
answer a question, just politely</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10315-1
00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:38.278
<v Martin Peck>say you can't do it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10337-0
00:59:38.288 --> 00:59:42.698
<v Martin Peck>Do not make up your own answers,
so these are all prompts that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10337-1
00:59:42.698 --> 00:59:45.918
<v Martin Peck>help guide the LLM and the
response you want.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10377-0
00:59:47.698 --> 00:59:54.422
<v Martin Peck>It's also allows you to uh,
sorry to sorry, trying to scroll</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10377-1
00:59:54.422 --> 01:00:00.815
<v Martin Peck>the wrong thing to then say
please use these documents or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10377-2
01:00:00.815 --> 01:00:06.768
<v Martin Peck>these references in answering
the question like here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10384-0
01:00:06.778 --> 01:00:09.008
<v Martin Peck>Here is the sort of reference
source material.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10436-0
01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:14.191
<v Martin Peck>Find your answers from here and
from nowhere else and so that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10436-1
01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:18.123
<v Martin Peck>allows you know, with these
things in deployed, we can then</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10436-2
01:00:18.123 --> 01:00:22.056
<v Martin Peck>ask questions of those those
PDFs and get responses back in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10436-3
01:00:22.056 --> 01:00:26.250
<v Martin Peck>this umm, you see it now there's
a I'm not going to demonstrate</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10436-4
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:26.578
<v Martin Peck>this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10450-0
01:00:26.588 --> 01:00:31.498
<v Martin Peck>Now there is a video I believe
in the teams channel.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10463-0
01:00:32.848 --> 01:00:36.408
<v Martin Peck>That's where a which we use for
the the ECN demo.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10472-0
01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.098
<v Martin Peck>James Griffin, one of the team.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10500-0
01:00:38.108 --> 01:00:41.506
<v Martin Peck>One of Microsoft team did a
pretty good job of, yeah,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10500-1
01:00:41.506 --> 01:00:44.778
<v Martin Peck>talking over a video and and and
playing that back.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10493-0
01:00:42.388 --> 01:00:42.548
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>But.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10513-0
01:00:46.008 --> 01:00:49.838
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>But in one question, do we have
a control on how to chunk?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10525-0
01:00:50.388 --> 01:00:53.618
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>I mean to fix this chunk size
and everything and reindex.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10541-0
01:00:53.828 --> 01:00:57.427
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>Or does it have that capability
with this accelerator or is it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10541-1
01:00:57.427 --> 01:00:58.398
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>just the default?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10543-0
01:00:59.888 --> 01:01:00.698
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10549-0
01:01:00.708 --> 01:01:03.098
<v Martin Peck>So, umm, so let's go.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10551-0
01:01:03.108 --> 01:01:03.438
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10558-0
01:01:03.448 --> 01:01:05.118
<v Martin Peck>So let's talk about that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10582-0
01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:08.954
<v Martin Peck>So I mean, yes, and I the honest
answer is I don't know for this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10582-1
01:01:08.954 --> 01:01:10.838
<v Martin Peck>particular, uh, demonstrator uh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10591-0
01:01:10.848 --> 01:01:13.728
<v Martin Peck>But in terms of UM in general,
yes.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10595-0
01:01:13.738 --> 01:01:16.858
<v Martin Peck>So the reason we we deployed.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10615-0
01:01:18.888 --> 01:01:25.598
<v Martin Peck>This demo was because we need to
do a demo and so I think, uh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10631-0
01:01:25.608 --> 01:01:28.861
<v Martin Peck>Does anybody know if this if we
can change the chunk size on</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10631-1
01:01:28.861 --> 01:01:29.128
<v Martin Peck>this?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10644-0
01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:32.108
<v Martin Peck>I imagine you can like looking
through the code.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10682-0
01:01:32.298 --> 01:01:35.534
<v Martin Peck>The other projects that we have
been, umm, I was gonna be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10682-1
01:01:35.534 --> 01:01:39.104
<v Martin Peck>difficult to demonstrate it from
here because I can't get to it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10682-2
01:01:39.104 --> 01:01:42.508
<v Martin Peck>or actually no, sorry I can't
get to hear and I can't get to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10682-3
01:01:42.508 --> 01:01:43.568
<v Martin Peck>get help from here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10688-0
01:01:43.578 --> 01:01:44.578
<v Martin Peck>So one moment I'm just gonna.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10703-0
01:01:47.898 --> 01:01:48.688
<v Martin Peck>Uh, it's.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10726-0
01:01:48.128 --> 01:01:51.593
<v Tanya Borisova>Martin, if you want the RAG
experiment accelerator, it is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10704-0
01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:48.868
<v David Moore>At.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10726-1
01:01:51.593 --> 01:01:54.998
<v Tanya Borisova>also in the Novartis as though
I've posted it yesterday.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10743-0
01:01:55.408 --> 01:01:58.777
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, but it's the advantage in
the vas, though that is dead or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10743-1
01:01:58.777 --> 01:01:59.198
<v Martin Peck>I can't.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10747-0
01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:01.328
<v Martin Peck>I yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10752-0
01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:01.768
<v Tanya Borisova>Oh, yes, Sir, shouldn't.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10753-0
01:02:01.338 --> 01:02:02.748
<v Martin Peck>So I'm so let me.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10780-0
01:02:04.918 --> 01:02:10.384
<v Martin Peck>Let me think Carol can do this
to answer your question is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10780-1
01:02:10.384 --> 01:02:13.118
<v Martin Peck>there's become back to, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10814-0
01:02:13.168 --> 01:02:18.180
<v Martin Peck>So in the ECN demo, it's worth
keeping in mind the ECN demo is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10814-1
01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:23.033
<v Martin Peck>nothing more than taking this
open source project, deploying</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10814-2
01:02:23.033 --> 01:02:25.738
<v Martin Peck>it, and then ingesting some
data.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10861-0
01:02:26.488 --> 01:02:30.752
<v Martin Peck>We haven't done anything to sort
of customize this in terms of,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10861-1
01:02:30.752 --> 01:02:34.882
<v Martin Peck>to be honest in terms of the
prompts that you see in the back</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10861-2
01:02:34.882 --> 01:02:39.013
<v Martin Peck>here in the configuration or the
chunk size, the the way it's</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10861-3
01:02:39.013 --> 01:02:42.078
<v Martin Peck>sort of chunking those documents
or anything.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10887-0
01:02:42.088 --> 01:02:46.428
<v Martin Peck>So this is a sort of right off
the shelf, deploy it, give it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10887-1
01:02:46.428 --> 01:02:50.128
<v Martin Peck>some data, ask it some
questions, see what it does.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10918-0
01:02:50.778 --> 01:02:54.795
<v Martin Peck>And it was really to sort of
less to do with, you know is it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10918-1
01:02:54.795 --> 01:02:58.681
<v Martin Peck>giving perfect or good answers
and to say is it giving any</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10918-2
01:02:58.681 --> 01:02:59.208
<v Martin Peck>answers?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10921-0
01:02:59.298 --> 01:03:00.128
<v Martin Peck>Is this a?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10931-0
01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:03.418
<v Martin Peck>There's even a sort of an
experience, a user experience.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10943-0
01:03:03.428 --> 01:03:06.268
<v Martin Peck>That, umm, that makes sense
within the parcels.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10999-0
01:03:06.338 --> 01:03:10.018
<v Martin Peck>So this particular UM project
I'm sure you can change the the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10999-1
01:03:10.018 --> 01:03:13.758
<v Martin Peck>the size that it breaks those
documents up into the chunk size</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10999-2
01:03:13.758 --> 01:03:17.616
<v Martin Peck>and how much they overlap, but I
don't think we've done anything</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10999-3
01:03:17.616 --> 01:03:21.177
<v Martin Peck>to configure it and I can't
honestly tell you exactly where</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/10999-4
01:03:21.177 --> 01:03:23.908
<v Martin Peck>you would do that on this
particular project.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11019-0
01:03:24.878 --> 01:03:29.518
<v Martin Peck>Umm, the of the source.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11001-0
01:03:24.948 --> 01:03:25.128
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11023-0
01:03:30.048 --> 01:03:33.305
<v Martin Peck>Other projects that we have been
using is a thing called the RAG</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11023-1
01:03:33.305 --> 01:03:34.458
<v Martin Peck>Experiment Accelerator.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11036-0
01:03:34.568 --> 01:03:37.298
<v Martin Peck>Now I would like to show to you
because it's.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11041-0
01:03:38.608 --> 01:03:39.978
<v Martin Peck>Is that gonna load?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11043-0
01:03:40.638 --> 01:03:41.268
<v Martin Peck>Hey. OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11069-0
01:03:43.448 --> 01:03:49.591
<v Martin Peck>Within the repositories of the
Azure Dev OPS Instance, RAG</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11069-1
01:03:49.591 --> 01:03:55.838
<v Martin Peck>Novartis starter is a is the
project that we would use for.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11085-0
01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:04.068
<v Martin Peck>For this and this project, this
is 1 moment I'll get up.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11093-0
01:04:07.008 --> 01:04:09.648
<v Martin Peck>I'm going to when you're at.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11138-0
01:04:14.278 --> 01:04:17.408
<v Martin Peck>Put this into the chat just so
it's variable.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11151-0
01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:21.311
<v Martin Peck>So this this URL almost
certainly won't work for you,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11151-1
01:04:21.311 --> 01:04:25.709
<v Martin Peck>and I if you have a GitHub ID,
can you please drop it either</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11151-2
01:04:25.709 --> 01:04:29.963
<v Martin Peck>onto the mural or into the chat,
actually drop it onto the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11151-3
01:04:29.963 --> 01:04:30.468
<v Martin Peck>Murali?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11167-0
01:04:30.478 --> 01:04:34.283
<v Martin Peck>I think we will lose access to
the chat after this meeting so</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11167-1
01:04:34.283 --> 01:04:35.388
<v Martin Peck>that in Session 2.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11183-0
01:04:37.508 --> 01:04:39.673
<v Martin Peck>By session two you can you can
look at this repository</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11183-1
01:04:39.673 --> 01:04:40.028
<v Martin Peck>yourself.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11192-0
01:04:40.038 --> 01:04:42.938
<v Martin Peck>It's it's currently a private
repository.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11208-0
01:04:43.578 --> 01:04:48.916
<v Martin Peck>Only Microsoft people and others
who have been invited into it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11208-1
01:04:48.916 --> 01:04:50.018
<v Martin Peck>can see this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11258-0
01:04:50.068 --> 01:04:53.782
<v Martin Peck>It's due to be open sourced, so
actually it made public at the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11258-1
01:04:53.782 --> 01:04:57.437
<v Martin Peck>end of this month, which is not
great for today, but it means</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11258-2
01:04:57.437 --> 01:05:00.974
<v Martin Peck>like in a couple of weeks time,
hopefully this will be, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11258-3
01:05:00.974 --> 01:05:04.688
<v Martin Peck>know, accessible to anybody, the
right experiment accelerator.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11268-0
01:05:05.238 --> 01:05:07.578
<v Martin Peck>And this is a, uh, a version of
it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11272-0
01:05:08.598 --> 01:05:08.868
<v Martin Peck>Umm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11306-0
01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:15.007
<v Martin Peck>Is is a set of tools set of
Python scripts that are designed</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11306-1
01:05:15.007 --> 01:05:20.564
<v Martin Peck>to help us working out the
optimal way of chunking, parsing</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11306-2
01:05:20.564 --> 01:05:25.658
<v Martin Peck>these documents, and how much
overlap there should be?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11312-0
01:05:26.448 --> 01:05:28.578
<v Martin Peck>Can someone remind me, Tanya?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11330-0
01:05:28.588 --> 01:05:33.345
<v Martin Peck>Maybe where that is that
configuration of like those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11330-1
01:05:33.345 --> 01:05:36.218
<v Martin Peck>parameters in in the repository?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11350-0
01:05:37.818 --> 01:05:42.348
<v Tanya Borisova>Yes, there is a config folder
and the conflix folder.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11356-0
01:05:42.478 --> 01:05:43.808
<v Tanya Borisova>It's right on your screen.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11359-0
01:05:43.178 --> 01:05:43.438
<v Martin Peck>Uh, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11367-0
01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:47.198
<v Tanya Borisova>It's a conflict for the not the
environment. Yes.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11372-0
01:05:48.168 --> 01:05:48.578
<v Tanya Borisova>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11380-0
01:05:48.588 --> 01:05:50.308
<v Tanya Borisova>So all of the parameters are
here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11401-0
01:05:49.028 --> 01:05:53.688
<v Martin Peck>Cool, but so this, this
accelerator or this this code</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11401-1
01:05:53.688 --> 01:05:58.608
<v Martin Peck>base is is not designed to be a
I guess an end solution.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11425-0
01:05:58.618 --> 01:06:03.775
<v Martin Peck>What it's designed to do is
allow you to experiments with</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11425-1
01:06:03.775 --> 01:06:07.598
<v Martin Peck>various different junk sizes and
overlaps.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11439-0
01:06:07.608 --> 01:06:12.178
<v Martin Peck>So here we can define an array
of different chunk sizes.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11499-0
01:06:12.188 --> 01:06:15.539
<v Martin Peck>So we can say we wanna take 1000
characters from each of the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11499-1
01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:18.726
<v Martin Peck>documents at the time, and we
want them to overlap by 200</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11499-2
01:06:18.726 --> 01:06:22.242
<v Martin Peck>characters characters each time,
and that's how we want to sort</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11499-3
01:06:22.242 --> 01:06:25.594
<v Martin Peck>of break these documents down
and then index them and create</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11499-4
01:06:25.594 --> 01:06:26.748
<v Martin Peck>embeddings from them.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-0
01:06:28.638 --> 01:06:33.115
<v Martin Peck>This code base is designed to
then allow you to say well</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-1
01:06:33.115 --> 01:06:37.670
<v Martin Peck>actually I wanna try, you know
1500 and 1500 and 200 with</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-2
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:42.539
<v Martin Peck>overlap sizes of 200 and 100 and
500 and whatever and it will</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-3
01:06:42.539 --> 01:06:47.409
<v Martin Peck>then help automate or all of the
permutations of those things</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-4
01:06:47.409 --> 01:06:52.200
<v Martin Peck>with different umm yeah and and
whole bunch of other sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-5
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.991
<v Martin Peck>parameters so that you can find
you know for this particular</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11591-6
01:06:56.991 --> 01:07:00.918
<v Martin Peck>type of document an optimal set
of configuration.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11613-0
01:07:01.368 --> 01:07:05.798
<v Martin Peck>So it's not an end, it's not a
sort of, you know, sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11613-1
01:07:05.798 --> 01:07:07.708
<v Martin Peck>product in its own right.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11643-0
01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.800
<v Martin Peck>It's a sort of scripts that
allow you to go through that,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11643-1
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.097
<v Martin Peck>like somewhat laborious, sort of
repetitive, trying these things</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11643-2
01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.568
<v Martin Peck>out and seeing what's better.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11659-0
01:07:16.138 --> 01:07:20.932
<v Martin Peck>But do it at scale and one of
the things that Tanya has worked</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11659-1
01:07:20.932 --> 01:07:21.998
<v Martin Peck>on is so this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11693-0
01:07:23.758 --> 01:07:28.024
<v Martin Peck>In its original form was sort of
Python files that would run, for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11693-1
01:07:28.024 --> 01:07:32.225
<v Martin Peck>example, from your cloud PC and
use as your services to do those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11693-2
01:07:32.225 --> 01:07:32.678
<v Martin Peck>things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11713-0
01:07:32.888 --> 01:07:37.432
<v Martin Peck>But instead we built we we've
added functionality and allow</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11713-1
01:07:37.432 --> 01:07:39.628
<v Martin Peck>you to run those in Azure ML.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11728-0
01:07:39.638 --> 01:07:42.808
<v Martin Peck>So you can run those things in
and those URL pipeline and do</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11728-1
01:07:42.808 --> 01:07:43.588
<v Martin Peck>the same thing.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11768-0
01:07:43.598 --> 01:07:47.436
<v Martin Peck>Essentially, run a whole load of
umm experiments is overloaded</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11768-1
01:07:47.436 --> 01:07:51.334
<v Martin Peck>word, but experiments that are
around different chunk sizes and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11768-2
01:07:51.334 --> 01:07:55.111
<v Martin Peck>different overlaps and different
ways of even comparing those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11768-3
01:07:55.111 --> 01:07:55.538
<v Martin Peck>things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11803-0
01:07:55.548 --> 01:07:59.655
<v Martin Peck>So in terms of how you looking
at the yeah, cosine similarity</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11803-1
01:07:59.655 --> 01:08:03.697
<v Martin Peck>or something else in terms of
like how similar, you know how</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11803-2
01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:05.618
<v Martin Peck>good your search results are.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11811-0
01:08:05.908 --> 01:08:07.198
<v Martin Peck>So you can come to some
conclusion.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11842-0
01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:11.643
<v Martin Peck>Actually for my data we get best
the better performance with this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11842-1
01:08:11.643 --> 01:08:15.743
<v Martin Peck>particular set of configuration
and then you could go on and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11842-2
01:08:15.743 --> 01:08:16.818
<v Martin Peck>build something.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11890-0
01:08:16.828 --> 01:08:22.066
<v Martin Peck>You could take that to a uh, you
know, a sort of more polished,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11890-1
01:08:22.066 --> 01:08:27.059
<v Martin Peck>polished user interface and a
polished system, and know that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11890-2
01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:31.889
<v Martin Peck>these are the this is the way
that we want to set it up is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11890-3
01:08:31.889 --> 01:08:32.298
<v Martin Peck>that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11888-0
01:08:32.018 --> 01:08:32.198
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>OK.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11894-0
01:08:32.928 --> 01:08:34.348
<v Martin Peck>But does that make sense?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11895-0
01:08:33.868 --> 01:08:35.248
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11898-0
01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:39.008
<v Martin Peck>Cool.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11905-0
01:08:39.018 --> 01:08:41.638
<v Martin Peck>So, uh, whereas mural gone
right?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11936-0
01:08:43.588 --> 01:08:48.144
<v Martin Peck>So yeah, so RAG as a concept is
really around and feeding a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11936-1
01:08:48.144 --> 01:08:52.777
<v Martin Peck>large language model with stuff
so they can answer questions</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11936-2
01:08:52.777 --> 01:08:54.068
<v Martin Peck>about that stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11954-0
01:08:55.608 --> 01:08:58.624
<v Martin Peck>Large language models, you know,
they don't learn, they don't</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11954-1
01:08:58.624 --> 01:09:00.618
<v Martin Peck>change over time, but you can
feed them.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11995-0
01:09:03.158 --> 01:09:08.323
<v Martin Peck>Data and then ask them to answer
questions about that data and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11995-1
01:09:08.323 --> 01:09:13.570
<v Martin Peck>the ECN demo is essentially a an
implementation of RAG which we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/11995-2
01:09:13.570 --> 01:09:18.408
<v Martin Peck>used to go off the concepts and
explain how it might work.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12011-0
01:09:18.858 --> 01:09:22.428
<v Martin Peck>Neither of the repositories that
we have here, neither the ECN</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12011-1
01:09:22.428 --> 01:09:24.128
<v Martin Peck>demo repository, which is the.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12021-0
01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:32.808
<v Martin Peck>I think I've just lost
connectivity again.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12034-0
01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:36.818
<v Martin Peck>Near the end demo, which is
called ECN demo.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12066-0
01:09:36.828 --> 01:09:41.564
<v Martin Peck>I believe, or this RAG Novartis
starter demo should be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12066-1
01:09:41.564 --> 01:09:47.075
<v Martin Peck>considered as end as an end goal
or a product that you'd put in</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12066-2
01:09:47.075 --> 01:09:48.798
<v Martin Peck>front of real users.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12129-0
01:09:49.008 --> 01:09:53.702
<v Martin Peck>One is that a demo to sort of
demonstrate the concepts and to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12129-1
01:09:53.702 --> 01:09:58.547
<v Martin Peck>get people interested, excited,
educated about, you know what's</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12129-2
01:09:58.547 --> 01:10:03.014
<v Martin Peck>possible and the other this one
here, the rag and Novartis</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12129-3
01:10:03.014 --> 01:10:07.859
<v Martin Peck>starter one the is A is a set of
tools that I data scientist or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12129-4
01:10:07.859 --> 01:10:11.948
<v Martin Peck>software engineer would use to
try and work out well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12144-0
01:10:12.828 --> 01:10:16.778
<v Martin Peck>Can we get good results from
from this and what?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12188-0
01:10:16.788 --> 01:10:19.906
<v Martin Peck>And if we, you know, if we're
trying to get good results</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12188-1
01:10:19.906 --> 01:10:23.298
<v Martin Peck>trying to get some good search
results or good responses from</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12188-2
01:10:23.298 --> 01:10:26.745
<v Martin Peck>the large language model, how
what configuration do we need to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12188-3
01:10:26.745 --> 01:10:28.988
<v Martin Peck>use to get the best results out
of that?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12207-0
01:10:31.028 --> 01:10:35.320
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, that looks like a probably
lost connectivity again to the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12207-1
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.058
<v Martin Peck>so dev OPS.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12210-0
01:10:38.098 --> 01:10:38.278
<v Martin Peck>Sorry.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12212-0
01:10:38.548 --> 01:10:38.978
<v Martin Peck>I'm.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12218-0
01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:42.448
<v Martin Peck>That's really where.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12233-0
01:10:42.498 --> 01:10:46.108
<v Martin Peck>So I'm conscious that we've got
15 minutes left in this session.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12248-0
01:10:46.498 --> 01:10:48.988
<v Martin Peck>You know, we're clearly not
gonna get all the way through.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12285-0
01:10:48.998 --> 01:10:52.469
<v Martin Peck>I'm probably not going to talk
about data, so I'm just gonna go</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12285-1
01:10:52.469 --> 01:10:55.940
<v Martin Peck>over there and I'm not gonna get
through these experiments, but</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12285-2
01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:59.520
<v Martin Peck>partly because I can't even show
you the the board or the wiki or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12285-3
01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.008
<v Martin Peck>anything.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12311-0
01:11:00.018 --> 01:11:04.682
<v Martin Peck>So let me just add to a higher
level and let's hope that next</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12311-1
01:11:04.682 --> 01:11:08.068
<v Martin Peck>time we meet, we can look at
this in detail.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12321-0
01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:11.268
<v Martin Peck>Experiment one, as I said, was
really sorry.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12377-0
01:11:11.408 --> 01:11:16.715
<v Martin Peck>Sumit, 2, was really trying to
work out whether we had, whether</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12377-1
01:11:16.715 --> 01:11:21.525
<v Martin Peck>it was possible to take the
large for the lengthy complex</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12377-2
01:11:21.525 --> 01:11:26.666
<v Martin Peck>and questions that come in from
health authorities and in any</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12377-3
01:11:26.666 --> 01:11:31.559
<v Martin Peck>way get any traction with a
large language model to get it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12377-4
01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:31.808
<v Martin Peck>to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12414-0
01:11:31.878 --> 01:11:36.232
<v Martin Peck>You know, I don't understand the
question or be able to parse the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12414-1
01:11:36.232 --> 01:11:40.323
<v Martin Peck>question rather and then to be
able to use search indexes and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12414-2
01:11:40.323 --> 01:11:42.698
<v Martin Peck>the embeddings of these from
these.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12466-0
01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:48.471
<v Martin Peck>These are questions, embeddings
being a vector version of that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12466-1
01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:52.962
<v Martin Peck>question, A using a model to
take a chunk of text and turn it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12466-2
01:11:52.962 --> 01:11:57.091
<v Martin Peck>into a an array of floating
point numbers, whether those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12466-3
01:11:57.091 --> 01:12:00.858
<v Martin Peck>embeddings were useful and that
was experiment two.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12476-0
01:12:00.928 --> 01:12:05.888
<v Martin Peck>Experiment three would have been
to have run the the repository.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-0
01:12:05.908 --> 01:12:11.286
<v Martin Peck>I'm just showing to you against
a large number of real dossiers</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-1
01:12:11.286 --> 01:12:16.496
<v Martin Peck>to work out all these dossiers,
something that you know again</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-2
01:12:16.496 --> 01:12:21.791
<v Martin Peck>have content, that is, that we
can usefully junk and index and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-3
01:12:21.791 --> 01:12:27.169
<v Martin Peck>then retrieve data from, and I
think for both of these, but the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-4
01:12:27.169 --> 01:12:32.211
<v Martin Peck>jury is somewhat still out on
both of those in terms of we,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-5
01:12:32.211 --> 01:12:37.085
<v Martin Peck>well, we certainly don't in the
in the last of those that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12563-6
01:12:37.085 --> 01:12:39.018
<v Martin Peck>experiment three stuff.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12579-0
01:12:39.328 --> 01:12:43.641
<v Martin Peck>We haven't had any significant
amount of dossiers to three sort</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12579-1
01:12:43.641 --> 01:12:45.258
<v Martin Peck>of answer that question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12613-0
01:12:45.788 --> 01:12:51.274
<v Martin Peck>We know that dossiers are
incredibly dense in terms of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12613-1
01:12:51.274 --> 01:12:56.761
<v Martin Peck>technical or scientific
terminology, but there's a lot</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12613-2
01:12:56.761 --> 01:12:58.158
<v Martin Peck>of UM, images.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12629-0
01:12:58.538 --> 01:13:03.858
<v Martin Peck>Uh diagrams tabular data, so we
know that they are nontrivial.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12675-0
01:13:03.928 --> 01:13:08.569
<v Martin Peck>Uh, and we don't know that if
that that we will be able to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12675-1
01:13:08.569 --> 01:13:13.209
<v Martin Peck>reliably, uh, chunk those
documents up, index them in some</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12675-2
01:13:13.209 --> 01:13:18.086
<v Martin Peck>way and then retrieve useful
information from those documents</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12675-3
01:13:18.086 --> 01:13:20.918
<v Martin Peck>to be able to sort of formulate
to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12691-0
01:13:20.988 --> 01:13:25.018
<v Martin Peck>So either answer questions about
those documents or formulate</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12691-1
01:13:25.018 --> 01:13:26.188
<v Martin Peck>answers from them.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12703-0
01:13:26.418 --> 01:13:30.828
<v Martin Peck>We've started to with the chat
with your data demonstrator.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12723-0
01:13:30.838 --> 01:13:36.914
<v Martin Peck>We've we have got half a dozen
or so PDFs from a synthetic</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12723-1
01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:39.798
<v Martin Peck>documents that are ingested.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12736-0
01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:46.297
<v Martin Peck>We've had a members of Novartis
teams that have asking this</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12736-1
01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:46.948
<v Martin Peck>question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12757-0
01:13:47.068 --> 01:13:50.513
<v Martin Peck>Sorry, asking this system
questions of those documents and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12757-1
01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:53.258
<v Martin Peck>with with some success and with
some failures.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12769-0
01:13:53.348 --> 01:13:56.918
<v Martin Peck>But as I said, this is a demo
that we haven't tweaked.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12780-0
01:13:56.928 --> 01:14:00.478
<v Martin Peck>We haven't tuned, we've deployed
as is.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12805-0
01:14:00.668 --> 01:14:04.748
<v Martin Peck>So exactly why some of the
answers are, umm, some of the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12805-1
01:14:04.748 --> 01:14:08.971
<v Martin Peck>the chats interactions are
successful and some of them are</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12805-2
01:14:08.971 --> 01:14:09.258
<v Martin Peck>not.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12815-0
01:14:10.188 --> 01:14:13.648
<v Martin Peck>We don't really know, so
experiment three.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12845-0
01:14:14.218 --> 01:14:17.617
<v Martin Peck>We haven't got that far with
experiment two in terms of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12845-1
01:14:17.617 --> 01:14:21.380
<v Martin Peck>searching for data, we've had
some a little bit more success,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12845-2
01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.658
<v Martin Peck>but there's probably still some
plenty to do we have.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12850-0
01:14:29.178 --> 01:14:29.728
<v Martin Peck>See if I've got.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12853-0
01:14:35.588 --> 01:14:36.298
<v Martin Peck>Connectivity.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12855-0
01:14:36.308 --> 01:14:36.468
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12878-0
01:14:37.688 --> 01:14:42.168
<v Martin Peck>Umm with experiment 2, which is
to be honest, where we will</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12878-1
01:14:42.168 --> 01:14:44.558
<v Martin Peck>start looking at code next time.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12902-0
01:14:45.338 --> 01:14:49.693
<v Martin Peck>We have spent a lot more time on
this and being able to, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12902-1
01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:53.048
<v Martin Peck>know, get a little bit further
along the path.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12911-0
01:14:53.118 --> 01:14:54.858
<v Martin Peck>So perhaps I'll come back to the
wiki.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12955-0
01:15:02.178 --> 01:15:08.290
<v Martin Peck>Just to sort of reiterate what
we're trying to do here, so we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12955-1
01:15:08.290 --> 01:15:13.910
<v Martin Peck>have, we were given some data
sort of, yeah, sort of MIT</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12955-2
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:19.628
<v Martin Peck>December time, an Excel sheet
with a set of 20 to 30,000.</v>

01:15:21.188 --> 01:15:24.218
<v Martin Peck>Historic Health authority
questions and their answers.</v>

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:27.509
<v Martin Peck>Not that the in general, not the
full question or the full</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/12980-1
01:15:27.509 --> 01:15:27.898
<v Martin Peck>answer.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13005-0
01:15:27.908 --> 01:15:31.654
<v Martin Peck>If they were incredibly long,
then they are truncated, but for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13005-1
01:15:31.654 --> 01:15:34.866
<v Martin Peck>the most part there's there's
enough data there to do</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13005-2
01:15:34.866 --> 01:15:35.758
<v Martin Peck>something with.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13032-0
01:15:36.668 --> 01:15:40.990
<v Martin Peck>We were given an Excel sheet and
we have taken that and reduce</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13032-1
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:45.107
<v Martin Peck>the number of columns because
there's a bunch of properties</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13032-2
01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:46.068
<v Martin Peck>against these.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13052-0
01:15:46.368 --> 01:15:52.112
<v Martin Peck>Umm these rows that we don't
care about or or that are not</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13052-1
01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:53.378
<v Martin Peck>useful to us?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13071-0
01:15:54.038 --> 01:15:59.238
<v Martin Peck>We've umm limited number of rows
by picking out particular types</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13071-1
01:15:59.238 --> 01:16:00.198
<v Martin Peck>of question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13075-0
01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:00.948
<v Martin Peck>Answer there.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13088-0
01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:04.718
<v Martin Peck>Again, this spreadsheet has has
a wide range of data in it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13097-0
01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:08.048
<v Martin Peck>Some of it again was deemed as
not so useful.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-0
01:16:08.558 --> 01:16:12.850
<v Martin Peck>We haven't actually cleaned it,
but that would we have</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-1
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:17.376
<v Martin Peck>considered clean the data, but
taking this input data and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-2
01:16:17.376 --> 01:16:21.980
<v Martin Peck>essentially splitting it so
taking some of it and indexing</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-3
01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:26.429
<v Martin Peck>that data in AI search in a zero
AI search so that it is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-4
01:16:26.429 --> 01:16:31.111
<v Martin Peck>available to be searched upon
and the other umm that's that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-5
01:16:31.111 --> 01:16:35.949
<v Martin Peck>data keeping that back so that
is not indexed, it's not parts</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-6
01:16:35.949 --> 01:16:40.631
<v Martin Peck>of the search index and then
really using this as test data</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-7
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:45.548
<v Martin Peck>to allow us to run a bunch of
experiments where we essentially</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13205-8
01:16:45.548 --> 01:16:49.528
<v Martin Peck>take a question from the right
hand side and then.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13228-0
01:16:50.028 --> 01:16:53.456
<v Martin Peck>Present that question so to to
AI search and say you please</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13228-1
01:16:53.456 --> 01:16:55.628
<v Martin Peck>find things that are similar to
this.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13235-0
01:16:57.418 --> 01:16:58.438
<v Martin Peck>Get some responses back.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13248-0
01:16:59.618 --> 01:17:03.228
<v Martin Peck>Evaluate those responses and
repeat and so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13255-0
01:17:04.888 --> 01:17:07.658
<v Martin Peck>Experiment two was essentially
that we took.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13269-0
01:17:10.138 --> 01:17:12.338
<v Martin Peck>We went well a couple of runs of
it, but we took.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13277-0
01:17:14.598 --> 01:17:15.518
<v Martin Peck>Three or seven questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13288-0
01:17:16.728 --> 01:17:18.198
<v Martin Peck>Uh, we first of all, we asked
the, you know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13319-0
01:17:20.318 --> 01:17:24.578
<v Martin Peck>Uh, business analyst, business
experts to to find us some</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13319-1
01:17:24.578 --> 01:17:28.618
<v Martin Peck>questions that they knew there
were good responses to.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13354-0
01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:33.591
<v Martin Peck>And so in that example, we had
three questions which we asked</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13354-1
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:38.632
<v Martin Peck>and we got responses back and we
asked people to then rate on a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13354-2
01:17:38.632 --> 01:17:40.838
<v Martin Peck>scale of five being awesome.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13363-0
01:17:40.848 --> 01:17:42.798
<v Martin Peck>You know, this is a perfect
answer to one.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13370-0
01:17:43.068 --> 01:17:44.318
<v Martin Peck>This is a very poor answer.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13384-0
01:17:44.448 --> 01:17:47.658
<v Martin Peck>Score the the the top five
results that they got back.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13392-0
01:17:48.268 --> 01:17:51.228
<v Martin Peck>We ran the same thing again with
20 or so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13432-0
01:17:53.508 --> 01:17:58.377
<v Martin Peck>Like not randomly picked books
I've picked by Microsoft like we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13432-1
01:17:58.377 --> 01:18:03.018
<v Martin Peck>picked 20 questions from here
and again ran the same process</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13432-2
01:18:03.018 --> 01:18:07.507
<v Martin Peck>and asked for experts to score
those results again between</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13432-3
01:18:07.507 --> 01:18:07.888
<v Martin Peck>five.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13440-0
01:18:08.128 --> 01:18:10.038
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, that's a perfect answer to
to one.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13455-0
01:18:12.278 --> 01:18:16.767
<v Martin Peck>Experience to 2.12 point two are
essentially variations on that</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13455-1
01:18:16.767 --> 01:18:17.188
<v Martin Peck>theme.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13473-0
01:18:19.478 --> 01:18:21.892
<v Martin Peck>And we can go into that a bit
more detailed exactly what they</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13473-1
01:18:21.892 --> 01:18:22.048
<v Martin Peck>are.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13500-0
01:18:22.058 --> 01:18:27.688
<v Martin Peck>I think next time, OK, that's
probably not as far as I think</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13500-1
01:18:27.688 --> 01:18:31.288
<v Martin Peck>we were hoping to get in this
session.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13560-0
01:18:32.978 --> 01:18:37.228
<v Martin Peck>I've talked to I've sort of teed
up some conversation around the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13560-1
01:18:37.228 --> 01:18:41.150
<v Martin Peck>experiments, but I think we're
gonna probably, there you go</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13560-2
01:18:41.150 --> 01:18:44.942
<v Martin Peck>into the minute more detail and
and show you the code and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13560-3
01:18:44.942 --> 01:18:48.996
<v Martin Peck>probably it may well be easier
to show you those experiments,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13560-4
01:18:48.996 --> 01:18:52.723
<v Martin Peck>those those specifically
experiment two stuff by opening</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13560-5
01:18:52.723 --> 01:18:55.338
<v Martin Peck>the notebooks and walking
through them.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13569-0
01:18:56.438 --> 01:18:59.138
<v Martin Peck>So there's like 7 minutes left
here.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13594-0
01:19:01.108 --> 01:19:05.237
<v Martin Peck>Any comments, questions,
thoughts has any of this been</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13594-1
01:19:05.237 --> 01:19:09.666
<v Martin Peck>either useful, mind numbingly
tedious the wrong thing, the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13594-2
01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:11.018
<v Martin Peck>right thing? Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13606-0
01:19:12.758 --> 01:19:13.638
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>No, it was good.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13610-0
01:19:12.818 --> 01:19:13.458
<v Martin Peck>Anything back?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13618-0
01:19:13.678 --> 01:19:16.918
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>Nothing, but maybe for for
tomorrow's session.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-0
01:19:16.928 --> 01:19:22.056
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>If you could stress some bit on
how you evaluated the results</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-1
01:19:22.056 --> 01:19:27.266
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>and how many iterations that you
have done in terms of umm uh,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-2
01:19:27.266 --> 01:19:32.725
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>you know finding out or refining
the search part, that would be a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13659-0
01:19:31.818 --> 01:19:31.998
<v Martin Peck>Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-3
01:19:32.725 --> 01:19:37.853
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>good a good, a good thing to
learn and and I in the beginning</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-4
01:19:37.853 --> 01:19:42.650
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>of the session there were few
things I think I don't know</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-5
01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:47.364
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>whether you will be able to
answer it but it is it looks</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-6
01:19:47.364 --> 01:19:52.740
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>like we need a business a person
to answer the questions because</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13722-7
01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.958
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>they if you go to the ohh the
user journey PDF so.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13758-0
01:19:57.018 --> 01:20:01.822
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>There were, uh, apart from
dossiers and Haq database, there</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13758-1
01:20:01.822 --> 01:20:06.147
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>were in the in the answering
part in the in the as is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13754-0
01:20:05.318 --> 01:20:05.628
<v Martin Peck>Sorry.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13769-0
01:20:05.678 --> 01:20:07.378
<v Martin Peck>Yeah, OK. Yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13758-2
01:20:06.147 --> 01:20:07.268
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>process, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13792-0
01:20:07.358 --> 01:20:11.263
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>So if you see there were like
foundry data, 42 other large</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13792-1
01:20:11.263 --> 01:20:15.366
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>data storage, public external
storages, all these things were</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13783-0
01:20:13.028 --> 01:20:13.228
<v Martin Peck>Yep.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13792-2
01:20:15.366 --> 01:20:16.028
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>mentioned.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13819-0
01:20:16.038 --> 01:20:20.185
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>Are we also considering that as
part of the experiment, or is it</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13819-1
01:20:20.185 --> 01:20:23.248
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>only the dose here and cheques
part of it? Ohh.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13816-0
01:20:22.788 --> 01:20:25.058
<v Martin Peck>Well, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13833-0
01:20:25.068 --> 01:20:28.453
<v Martin Peck>So I think the right now, no, we
haven't considered any of those</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13833-1
01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:28.818
<v Martin Peck>things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13873-0
01:20:28.828 --> 01:20:33.375
<v Martin Peck>So I think later when we when
we're in that sort of face to</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13873-1
01:20:33.375 --> 01:20:37.619
<v Martin Peck>face meeting in in Basel in
towards the end of January,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13873-2
01:20:37.619 --> 01:20:40.878
<v Martin Peck>there were a couple of other
data sources.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13909-0
01:20:40.928 --> 01:20:44.632
<v Martin Peck>Is, for example, there's a I
think we we we learned there's a</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13909-1
01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:48.097
<v Martin Peck>there's a one note or that
there's a there are strategies</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13909-2
01:20:48.097 --> 01:20:50.368
<v Martin Peck>to answering some of these
questions.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13926-0
01:20:50.378 --> 01:20:54.689
<v Martin Peck>So if a health authority says,
you know, could you please</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13926-1
01:20:54.689 --> 01:20:56.548
<v Martin Peck>justify XY and Z in this?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13937-0
01:20:56.618 --> 01:21:00.138
<v Martin Peck>But actually there are for some
health authorities.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13957-0
01:21:00.148 --> 01:21:02.695
<v Martin Peck>You may just simply answer that
question and for other health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13957-1
01:21:02.695 --> 01:21:04.708
<v Martin Peck>authorities, you may push back
on that question.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/13969-0
01:21:04.718 --> 01:21:08.278
<v Martin Peck>So it's not that there's a right
or wrong answer.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14010-0
01:21:08.288 --> 01:21:11.682
<v Martin Peck>There are strategies around
answering some of these things,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14010-1
01:21:11.682 --> 01:21:15.189
<v Martin Peck>and we learned that there's a
there are some sort of notes or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14010-2
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:18.470
<v Martin Peck>there's a OneNote file there,
certainly some some ways of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14010-3
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:19.998
<v Martin Peck>responding to those things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14035-0
01:21:20.098 --> 01:21:24.578
<v Martin Peck>And so there are definitely data
sources that sort of come into</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14035-1
01:21:24.578 --> 01:21:28.008
<v Martin Peck>this process that need to be
sort of considered.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14078-0
01:21:28.418 --> 01:21:32.068
<v Martin Peck>But the reason we sort of picked
the health authority, the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14078-1
01:21:32.068 --> 01:21:35.657
<v Martin Peck>historic health authority
question that dossier is as the</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14078-2
01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:39.370
<v Martin Peck>only data sources and to be
honest, I believe only dossiers</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14078-3
01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:41.288
<v Martin Peck>from like one part in the part.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14083-0
01:21:41.298 --> 01:21:42.078
<v Martin Peck>It's not from you know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-0
01:21:42.088 --> 01:21:46.158
<v Martin Peck>There are different sources for
both of those two things as well</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-1
01:21:46.158 --> 01:21:49.540
<v Martin Peck>was that we wanted to start
somewhere and start small</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-2
01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:53.047
<v Martin Peck>because if it turns out that
that a dense Leah could be</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-3
01:21:53.047 --> 01:21:56.992
<v Martin Peck>technical question such as the
one I showed earlier isn't, you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-4
01:21:56.992 --> 01:22:00.937
<v Martin Peck>know, we can't get any traction
with it with with one example,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-5
01:22:00.937 --> 01:22:04.632
<v Martin Peck>then it's probably you know,
very little likely that we're</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14157-6
01:22:04.632 --> 01:22:05.258
<v Martin Peck>gonna get.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14169-0
01:22:05.308 --> 01:22:07.158
<v Martin Peck>It doesn't matter how many data
sources you've got.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14210-0
01:22:07.228 --> 01:22:11.176
<v Martin Peck>If all of your questions look
similar and the large language</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14210-1
01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:15.255
<v Martin Peck>model is is incapable of like
ripping it apart in a useful way</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14210-2
01:22:15.255 --> 01:22:19.527
<v Martin Peck>and finding similar questions to
that question, then it's sort of</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14210-3
01:22:19.527 --> 01:22:20.498
<v Martin Peck>like game over.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14214-0
01:22:20.508 --> 01:22:21.698
<v Martin Peck>You might as well.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14239-0
01:22:22.808 --> 01:22:25.307
<v Martin Peck>You either have to sort of
rethink the approach or you have</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14239-1
01:22:25.307 --> 01:22:27.681
<v Martin Peck>to, you know, wait for the
technology to catch up, or or</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14239-2
01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:28.098
<v Martin Peck>something.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14250-0
01:22:28.108 --> 01:22:29.578
<v Martin Peck>There's there's something that
you need to do.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-0
01:22:29.588 --> 01:22:33.994
<v Martin Peck>So rather than consider every
single data source that possibly</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-1
01:22:33.994 --> 01:22:38.471
<v Martin Peck>exists and sort of bringing them
into into what we're doing, we</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-2
01:22:38.471 --> 01:22:42.947
<v Martin Peck>we we said well look just give
us one like one data source, one</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-3
01:22:42.947 --> 01:22:47.283
<v Martin Peck>type of document even I would
suggest if you you know picking</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-4
01:22:47.283 --> 01:22:51.760
<v Martin Peck>this up and still moving forward
you know one health authority,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-5
01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:56.096
<v Martin Peck>one type of question one you
know prove that this is possible</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-6
01:22:56.096 --> 01:23:00.433
<v Martin Peck>with a very small constrained
set of data and then expand out</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-7
01:23:00.433 --> 01:23:04.839
<v Martin Peck>I think if you were to sort of
consider all of these different</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14352-8
01:23:04.839 --> 01:23:06.658
<v Martin Peck>data sources up front you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14374-0
01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:11.000
<v Martin Peck>Very quickly be overwhelmed with
with an integration project and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14374-1
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.308
<v Martin Peck>you'd go through it.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14411-0
01:23:12.318 --> 01:23:15.838
<v Martin Peck>The process of OK, well, how do
we get all of these data sources</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14411-1
01:23:15.838 --> 01:23:18.817
<v Martin Peck>to big feed into something
without necessarily knowing</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14411-2
01:23:18.817 --> 01:23:22.230
<v Martin Peck>whether you were even gonna be
able to do anything useful with</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14411-3
01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:22.988
<v Martin Peck>them later on?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14424-0
01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:26.688
<v Martin Peck>So they're really, yeah, this
was useful to capture.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14444-0
01:23:27.818 --> 01:23:32.100
<v Martin Peck>But in terms of the experiments,
which are essentially like, is</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14444-1
01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:34.108
<v Martin Peck>it worth continuing or not it?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14449-0
01:23:34.118 --> 01:23:35.528
<v Martin Peck>Can we do this or not?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14464-0
01:23:35.658 --> 01:23:39.628
<v Martin Peck>We we wanted a much more
constrained so inputs to that.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14482-0
01:23:41.948 --> 01:23:44.108
<v Bali, Kiran Kumar>I left you sure? Sure.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14484-0
01:23:42.308 --> 01:23:45.048
<v Martin Peck>Uh, so I'll let you go your
hands up.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14488-0
01:23:46.608 --> 01:23:47.678
<v Brinth, Alette>Yes, thank you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14500-0
01:23:47.688 --> 01:23:49.198
<v Brinth, Alette>Uh, it just if we have.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14502-0
01:23:49.248 --> 01:23:50.058
<v Brinth, Alette>Uh, two minutes.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14515-0
01:23:50.068 --> 01:23:53.668
<v Brinth, Alette>Tanya, I saw you some emails on
the dev environment.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14530-0
01:23:53.788 --> 01:23:57.154
<v Brinth, Alette>Could you just add a high level
list like the issues that you're</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14530-1
01:23:57.154 --> 01:23:57.828
<v Brinth, Alette>experiencing?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14533-0
01:24:01.378 --> 01:24:01.618
<v Martin Peck>Right.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14544-0
01:24:02.608 --> 01:24:02.868
<v Brinth, Alette>Just.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14537-0
01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:03.518
<v Martin Peck>Can we take?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14551-0
01:24:03.758 --> 01:24:04.458
<v Martin Peck>Can we take that offline?</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14548-0
01:24:04.858 --> 01:24:05.708
<v Brinth, Alette>Yeah, totally.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14574-0
01:24:05.718 --> 01:24:08.065
<v Brinth, Alette>Very happy to umm just popped it
in the chat there, so if you</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14574-1
01:24:08.065 --> 01:24:09.958
<v Brinth, Alette>could send me a mail that would
be great. Thanks.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14591-0
01:24:12.228 --> 01:24:14.358
<v Martin Peck>That he was asking because I've
got a hard stop at half past.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14619-0
01:24:14.368 --> 01:24:17.212
<v Martin Peck>I mean, I'm happy for you to
carry on, but I think, yeah,</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14619-1
01:24:17.212 --> 01:24:18.978
<v Martin Peck>we've got a hard stop at half
past.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14639-0
01:24:19.548 --> 01:24:22.485
<v Brinth, Alette>Now offline is great, just would
love to understand umm what's</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14639-1
01:24:22.485 --> 01:24:25.328
<v Brinth, Alette>missing in terms of setting up
the dev environment at a high</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14639-2
01:24:25.328 --> 01:24:25.608
<v Brinth, Alette>level.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14641-0
01:24:25.618 --> 01:24:26.048
<v Brinth, Alette>Thank you.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14652-0
01:24:30.488 --> 01:24:35.818
<v Martin Peck>OK, so tomorrow, assuming or not
tomorrow.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14664-0
01:24:35.828 --> 01:24:37.088
<v Martin Peck>So I think it's a, yeah.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14667-0
01:24:37.598 --> 01:24:37.908
<v Anastasia Collins>Thursday.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14693-0
01:24:38.398 --> 01:24:42.158
<v Martin Peck>So it's like, yeah, on Thursday
we will so bit more in detail</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14693-1
01:24:42.158 --> 01:24:46.039
<v Martin Peck>about the experiments and I will
go through the Python code for</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14693-2
01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:46.828
<v Martin Peck>those things.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14712-0
01:24:47.538 --> 01:24:51.320
<v Martin Peck>I'm gonna sort of in doing that
point at some of your resources</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14712-1
01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.088
<v Martin Peck>and services.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14737-0
01:24:52.098 --> 01:24:55.242
<v Martin Peck>Uh, some things that sitting in
various resource groups and</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14737-1
01:24:55.242 --> 01:24:57.968
<v Martin Peck>we'll be showing some of the
data we've been using.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14751-0
01:24:58.838 --> 01:25:01.529
<v Martin Peck>I will be opening excel sheets
which have historic health</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14751-1
01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:02.828
<v Martin Peck>authority questions in them.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14756-0
01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.128
<v Martin Peck>I don't know.</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14805-0
01:25:04.288 --> 01:25:07.230
<v Martin Peck>I assume that we're not
recording, so the Microsoft</v>

996fc568-71b0-4cc2-8d92-280dcac381b0/14805-1
01:25:07.230 --> 01:25:10.794
