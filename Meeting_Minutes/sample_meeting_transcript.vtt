Hello, everyone. Thank you guys for coming to our weekly student success meeting.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.500
Um, and let's just get started.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.829
So I have our list of chronically absent students

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.829
here and I've been noticing a troubling trend.

5
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.590
Um, a lot of students are skipping on Fridays.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.579
Does anyone have any idea what's going on?

7
00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.420
I've heard some of my mentees talking about how it's

8
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.440
really hard to get out of bed on Fridays.

9
00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.360
It might be good if we did something like

10
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.709
a pancake breakfast to encourage them to come.

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.500
I think that's a great idea.

12
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:28.899
Let's try that next week.

13
00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.009
It might also be because a lot of students have

14
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.419
been getting sick now that it's getting colder outside.

15
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.939
I've had a number of students come by my office with symptoms,

16
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.310
like sniffling and coughing.

17
00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:41.909
We should put up posters with tips for not getting sick since it's almost flu season.

18
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:44.479
Like, you know, wash your hands after the bathroom, stuff like that.

19
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.319
I think that's a good idea and it'll be a good reminder for the teachers as well.

20
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.080
So, one other thing I wanted to talk about, um, there's a student I've noticed here,

21
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.189
John Smith,

22
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.560
he's missed seven days already and it's only November.

23
00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.880
Does anyone have an idea what's going on with him?

24
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.060
I might be able to fill in the gaps there.

25
00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:04.910
I talked to John today and he's really stressed out.

26
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.230
He's been dealing with helping his parents take

27
00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.019
care of his younger siblings during the day.

28
00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.220
Um It might actually be a good idea if he spoke to the guidance counselor a little bit.

29
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.629
I can talk to John today if you want to send him to my office after you meet with him.

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.220
It's a lot to deal with for a middle schooler.

31
00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:22.300
Great, thanks and, and

32
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620
I can help out with the family's childcare needs.

33
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:26.540
Uh I'll look for some free or low cost

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.750
resources in the community to share with John and he can share them with his family.

35
00:01:31.129 --> 00:01:33.139
Great. Well, some really good ideas here today.

36
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.059
Um Thanks for coming and if no one has anything else, I think we can wrap up.
