f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/212-0
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.308
And to start with, we're going
with the Super Charge field

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/212-1
00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:08.560
force.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/280-0
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.384
So just to give like a you know
a use case Briefing or the use

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/280-1
00:00:12.384 --> 00:00:15.939
case behind like what, what was
the idea behind and how we are

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/280-2
00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.606
helping out the field force was
available in the market like the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/280-3
00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:23.105
you know out in The Who is out
in the market and going to the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/280-4
00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.490
HCP's for the promotions and
everything for our drug right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/299-0
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.554
How we're able to help them and
support them is something what

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/299-1
00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.090
we have done with the
Supercharge.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/351-0
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.681
So Supercharge is basically what
we have created is sort of a

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/351-1
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.888
tool right here where we are
supporting the field force to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/351-2
00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:43.880
actually prepare for the any
drug, OK, they're going to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/351-3
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.586
basically go out into the market
or talk to HCP's right for their

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/351-4
00:00:48.586 --> 00:00:49.870
promotions, right.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/361-0
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.210
So how how we are doing this?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/370-0
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.090
Like it's sort of a simulation
of sort.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/396-0
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.277
We can upload few document set
of documents where any field

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/396-1
00:00:57.277 --> 00:01:01.107
representative could actually
ask the questions to the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/396-2
00:01:01.107 --> 00:01:02.360
Supercharge right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/424-0
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.705
Where is it's like sort of a
conversational UI is which which

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/424-1
00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:10.831
is there, right, and the uh, it
will simulate the doctor's

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/424-2
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:12.020
intention, right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/441-0
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.909
It will Supercharge will give
you the questions and ask

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/441-1
00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.040
questions around that.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/464-0
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.536
OK, it will basically monitor or
give the feedback to the field

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/464-1
00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:23.830
force how they are actually uh
giving answers.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/478-0
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.740
How can they improvise like
they'll be?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/495-0
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.648
Uh, the further recommendations
of sort right where we could

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/495-1
00:01:29.648 --> 00:01:31.520
actually give to the field force
as well.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/517-0
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.276
So right, so that that would be
how we could be able to help the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/517-1
00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.640
field first, right.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/537-0
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.520
So that is one thing and then so
basically it's, but it will

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/537-1
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.150
enhance the experience of the
field force.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/579-0
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.012
And HCP's, when the field force
actually go into the basically

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/579-1
00:01:48.012 --> 00:01:51.619
into the market and and like
promote their product, right,

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/579-2
00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.348
since they will have the better
knowledge about the product,

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/579-3
00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.650
they would know what what's the
drug efficacy, right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/617-0
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.237
So the all these details they
could able to actually simulate

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/617-1
00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:03.690
through the tool and prepare
themselves before they go out

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/617-2
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.060
into the market and have an
interactions with the HCP's.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/619-0
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.800
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/631-0
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.630
So that's how and ultimately
like.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/674-0
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.844
Obviously, since there'll be a
better interactions, right, we

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/674-1
00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:16.255
would have for, uh, better sales
like business target, they'll be

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/674-2
00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:19.149
able to reach the business
targets and that's how we're

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/674-3
00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.940
going to help the field force
over all and all right.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/718-0
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.529
So yeah, this is as a bit of a
thinking behind the use case

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/718-1
00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.854
right from the Supercharge and
now maybe we can take you

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/718-2
00:02:28.854 --> 00:02:32.645
through the tool so that it will
be a bit more clear like how we

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/718-3
00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:33.520
are doing that.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/727-0
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.150
OK.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/730-0
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.450
Thank you, Vibhor.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/737-0
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.120
So I'll quickly share my screen.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/743-0
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.440
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/754-0
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.870
So so Supercharge is deployed in
the Azure web app.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/762-0
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.550
It has three layers to it.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/829-0
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.653
The front end layer basically on
reactor node and the middle

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/829-1
00:03:00.653 --> 00:03:05.506
layer which is or the middle
where using the fast API is to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/829-2
00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:10.602
connect the front end and the
back end using APIs and the back

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/829-3
00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:15.616
end layer which is the core LLM
layer using GPT 4 and text O2

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/829-4
00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:19.660
model and and now logging into
the Supercharge a.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/860-0
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.701
It has a the basic username and
password based authentication

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/860-1
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:29.647
which is encrypted and stored in
the Cosmos DB and this this is

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/860-2
00:03:29.647 --> 00:03:31.270
not the landing page.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/870-0
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.870
Usually the landing page will be
the the calendar view and the.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/891-0
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.942
And the field force will be able
to create a new events or

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/891-1
00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:42.230
appointments over here.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/960-0
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.456
Something like this based on
their appointment or convenient

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/960-1
00:03:46.456 --> 00:03:50.880
time that I have scheduled with
the doctors and when they click

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/960-2
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.027
on the appointment button it
gets enabled as a I mean there

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/960-3
00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:59.104
is a button that gets enabled
called get supercharged over

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/960-4
00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:03.321
here and apart from that there
is also a Workspace button on

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/960-5
00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:04.150
the sidebar.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/982-0
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.294
So when we click on this
Workspace button, the admins

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/982-1
00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:13.980
will have the documents uploaded
in the corresponding workspaces.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/991-0
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.400
So Supercharge is built to
support 3 languages.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1047-0
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.453
English, Chinese and Japanese
and here also if I'm clicking on

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1047-1
00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:29.102
any of the workspaces, the
English Workspace let us assume

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1047-2
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:33.908
and there is an ask Supercharge
button that will get enabled

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1047-3
00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:38.714
over here which will take this
to the the the core LLM layer

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1047-4
00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:38.950
uh.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-0
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.922
So as soon as the documents are
uploaded it will be chunked and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-1
00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:48.401
indexed and the indexes will get
created in Azure and the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-2
00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:53.111
summarization will happen on the
API layer and there will be

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-3
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.976
individual summary of the chunks
that will get created 1st and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-4
00:04:57.976 --> 00:05:02.455
then there will be an overall
general summary for all the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-5
00:05:02.455 --> 00:05:06.933
documents that is getting
uploaded in the Workspace we'll

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1124-6
00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:07.860
get created.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1149-0
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.923
So as I said, the summarization
happens on the API layer which

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1149-1
00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:16.580
will feed as the input for these
questions.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1178-0
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.967
There are like in in chat in
charge PT we have seen like

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1178-1
00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:21.428
there there will be 4 questions
that could generate at the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1178-2
00:05:21.428 --> 00:05:21.720
bottom.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1212-0
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.944
Similarly, in Supercharge also
we have 4 questions that gets

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1212-1
00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:28.052
created which is based on the
summary of the the documents

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1212-2
00:05:28.052 --> 00:05:30.950
that is coming out of all the
things in the workspace.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1243-0
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.463
So this is this is all about
calendar and the Workspace and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1243-1
00:05:36.463 --> 00:05:40.449
here we have got 4 categories
which are Suraj is going to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1243-2
00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.060
explain about each of the
categories.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1278-0
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.892
Umm yeah, so in each Workspace
we'll feature the ask

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1278-1
00:05:47.892 --> 00:05:51.527
Supercharge section and in the
Ask Supercharge section

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1278-2
00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:55.426
basically user can query through
the knowledge base of the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1278-3
00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:56.880
Workspace they select.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1295-0
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:02.551
So right now Ruthran is in a
drug Workspace like KESIMPTA

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1295-1
00:06:02.551 --> 00:06:03.520
Workspace.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1312-0
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.284
So here user can input their own
query or maybe choose from this

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1312-1
00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.040
pre populated questions.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1318-0
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.940
So we have 4 queries, right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1331-0
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.418
All categories drug efficacy,
adverse events and objects and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1331-1
00:06:15.418 --> 00:06:15.930
handling.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1343-0
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.870
So user can query within any of
these categories, right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1355-0
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.970
And let's suppose user will
input their query Ruthran.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1376-0
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.210
Maybe you can input one query,
yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1379-0
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.840
Yeah, I have problem sample
question that you can.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1401-0
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.708
So whenever user will input the
query basically there will be a

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1401-1
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.530
semantic search through the
complete knowledge base.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1429-0
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.864
The knowledge base, again as
Ruthran mentioned, may include

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1429-1
00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:41.129
all the different PDF and the
word documents which the user

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1429-2
00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.870
upload for that particular drug.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1453-0
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.474
So after getting the results of
the semantic search, the LLM

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1453-1
00:06:47.474 --> 00:06:51.190
will provide a constructive
answer to that query.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1468-0
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.370
So yeah, so for this query this
is the answer.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1501-0
00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.607
So here user can like query
through the complete thing and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1501-1
00:06:59.607 --> 00:07:03.366
in this sections out of these
four sections right the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1501-2
00:07:03.366 --> 00:07:06.150
objections section actually
stands out.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1520-0
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.171
Here user can inquire inquire
about any of the objections that

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1520-1
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:11.190
they might have.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1548-0
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.205
So yeah, and they can also
request the LLM to generate any

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1548-1
00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:20.970
objections like we have given a
like here.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1566-0
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.284
If you see the 4th question is
actually to suggest some

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1566-1
00:07:24.284 --> 00:07:26.290
potential objections from the
CP.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1591-0
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.935
So the field force can actually
ask Supercharge to generate the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1591-1
00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:35.399
objections and basically clarify
their objections before they go

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1591-2
00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.360
to the doctor.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1614-0
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.850
So this is the idea behind Ask
Supercharge and yeah and here we

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1614-1
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.060
have enabled the streaming
feature as well.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1644-0
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.130
So that user doesn't need to
wait for the complete response

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1644-1
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.240
to come and they can like go
through go and read through the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1644-2
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.770
response as and when it comes.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1665-0
00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.840
Also like one more feature we
have here in this screen which

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1665-1
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.430
is the save chat feature.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1697-0
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.748
So user can actually save the
existing chat or umm they can

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1697-1
00:08:07.748 --> 00:08:12.057
also review the safe chats so
that feature is also there at

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1697-2
00:08:12.057 --> 00:08:14.570
the top Ruthran if you can
scroll.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1714-0
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:20.099
Yeah, using this button user can
save the chat, so this is about

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1707-0
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.100
Yeah, this one.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1714-1
00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.430
Ask Supercharge.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1727-0
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:28.960
The last part is for simulation
over to you Ruthran.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1729-0
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:30.290
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1742-0
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.770
So yes, I think this is your yet
to complete.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1745-0
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.870
OK, fine.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1768-0
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.085
So Simulation part in the
simulation LLM will act as a

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1768-1
00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:45.850
doctor and it will ask questions
to the field force.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1791-0
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.625
This will help field forced to
get prepared for the interview

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1791-1
00:08:50.625 --> 00:08:52.470
before they visit to the
doctors.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1801-0
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.110
We have given the Doctor Persona
to the LLM here.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1843-0
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.359
We also use Azure speech
services to convert the speech

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1843-1
00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:08.224
to text and for the LLM to
process and the response from

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1843-2
00:09:08.224 --> 00:09:13.088
the LLM will be getting
converted from text to speech or

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1843-3
00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:14.710
using V yeah right.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1848-0
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.770
So now I'll I'll have this.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1853-0
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.000
Hello doctor.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1855-0
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.140
I am Ruthran.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1863-0
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.190
I'm here to discuss about the
KESIMPTA drug.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1872-0
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.300
It's a bit slow today.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1900-0
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.860
It it it, it gives the audio
also enabled so it has that both

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1900-1
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.660
both the text and the audio and
explain the audio.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1927-0
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.282
I don't have the option to
enable the audio, I mean to to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1927-1
00:09:50.282 --> 00:09:55.450
show the audio but within waters
environnent but yeah, so it it.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1948-0
00:09:55.460 --> 00:10:00.811
It basically asks now if I it
it's asking about a introduction

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1948-1
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.190
to KESIMPTA drug, right, so.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1963-0
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.293
OK, Nimita is the drug which is
used to treat multiple

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1963-1
00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:08.890
sclerosis.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1975-0
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.670
So basically an unknown the
conversation begins.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1985-0
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.450
Uh, it will ask several
questions.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1990-0
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.490
A after one after the other.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/1996-0
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:37.920
Yes.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2007-0
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:41.697
So this section also like shows
the audio capability within

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2007-1
00:10:41.697 --> 00:10:42.450
supercharge.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2025-0
00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.052
Here we can input the audio and
even get the output in the form

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2025-1
00:10:46.052 --> 00:10:46.670
of a audio.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2075-0
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.835
So and using this section,
basically user can or the field

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2075-1
00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:54.811
force can actually from ohh
simulate or talk to the doctor

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2075-2
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:58.921
like simulate their conversation
with the doctor before they

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2075-3
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:02.694
visit the Doctor, ensuring that
they are ready with any

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2075-4
00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:04.850
questions the doctor might have.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2082-0
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:11.810
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2087-0
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.540
So this is all about
Supercharge.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2093-0
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.700
So any questions that you have?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2101-0
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.310
So this is Nishan.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2105-0
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.840
Gotcha.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2107-0
00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.670
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2112-0
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.970
So we complete questions.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2152-0
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.168
So one question is so as we saw
right, I mean the drug name, you

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2152-1
00:11:32.168 --> 00:11:37.356
did not pick correctly like they
sent out the spelling was wrong

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2152-2
00:11:37.356 --> 00:11:39.750
when you you spoke to the mic.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2174-0
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.775
So for that, is there any
implication like the follow up

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2158-0
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:40.740
Right.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2174-1
00:11:43.775 --> 00:11:44.930
questions for that?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2190-0
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.960
Isn't that will it get affected
because of the misspelling?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2181-0
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.330
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2187-0
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.320
It is.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2201-0
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.860
It is because of the the VDI
environment.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2225-0
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:58.757
If the same see I'm in, I'm
using my own laptop and within

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2225-1
00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:01.920
that laptop I logged into
Novartis environment.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2251-0
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.472
But if if I I spell it correctly
within with the I mean outside

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2251-1
00:12:06.472 --> 00:12:09.240
within what is in the document,
right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2261-0
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.000
This without the VDI then it
works fine for us.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2263-0
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:12.500
I have.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2271-0
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.060
We have already tested all these
capabilities.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2274-0
00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:17.510
OK, alright.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2279-0
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.030
And then expression is.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2298-0
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.500
Now let's say you know I engage
in and conversation with your

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2298-1
00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:24.990
agent.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2319-0
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.489
Now at the end of the
conversation, how you know how

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2303-0
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:25.880
Umm.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2319-1
00:12:29.489 --> 00:12:32.280
good that conversation quality
was?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2342-0
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.957
Like you know, I mean how happy
the doctor uh is with the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2342-1
00:12:36.957 --> 00:12:39.130
answers that I will giving.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2352-0
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:42.620
So is there any sort of metrics
that we track there?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2383-0
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:49.716
We we were supposed to have that
as after the POC if it's moving

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2383-1
00:12:49.716 --> 00:12:54.669
to production, so the feedback
mechanism is not enabled for

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2383-2
00:12:54.669 --> 00:12:55.660
Supercharge.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2404-0
00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.245
So we were supposed to have that
as we it is not part of the POC

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2404-1
00:13:01.245 --> 00:13:02.720
for us to be honest.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2424-0
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.623
So we did not do that, but we'll
be able to do, if at all it is

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2424-1
00:13:06.623 --> 00:13:07.900
moving to production.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2429-0
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.860
Alright.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2443-0
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:15.013
And and for the response is that
it is generating like the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2443-1
00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:15.500
replies.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2453-0
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.830
Use any few short prompts or
something, or how is it?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2468-0
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.690
Sorry I did not catch the
question properly.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2469-0
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:25.230
No.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2473-0
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.750
So it is.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2481-0
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.730
It is a leading the response
right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2541-0
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.551
I would like to know more about
this in the PC and all right, so

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2499-0
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:33.460
Umm.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2541-1
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:38.066
for that I mean do you have any
underlying document that you

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2541-2
00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:42.211
have already put in place using
any retrieval augmented

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2541-3
00:13:42.211 --> 00:13:46.873
generation mechanism or is it
like a you know you are using as

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2526-0
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:43.290

00:13:46.873 --> 00:13:49.020
some sort of feature prompts?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2564-0
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.001

00:13:55.001 --> 00:13:57.670
this Workspace has been
maintained.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2602-0
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.971
If you can click on the
workspace, OK and so you know we

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.962
We still have, you know, 1520

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/2619-1

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.072
So there is what we put the this
landing page, but at the moment

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3254-1
00:17:17.072 --> 00:17:19.000
it doesn't have any feature
except for.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3272-0
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.626

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3290-1
00:17:26.469 --> 00:17:27.470
integration or not?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3303-0
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.530

Sure, sure.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3364-0
00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.050

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.380
So let me just share my screen.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3376-0
00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:54.550
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3399-0
00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.607
So Sam is basically is there to
help in the hiring process and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3399-1
00:17:59.607 --> 00:18:01.370
the screening process.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3421-0
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:07.624
And here we are utilizing Jenny
I capability and text to voice

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3421-1
00:18:07.624 --> 00:18:12.310
and voice to text capabilities
of Azure services.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3446-0
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:16.000
So I'll just talk about some of
the sequence diagrams that we

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3446-1
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.330
have in place so that we can
better understand the system.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3448-0
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:21.730
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3472-0
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:25.832
So yeah, this is the first flow
where let's just say there are

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3472-1
00:18:25.832 --> 00:18:27.890
basically 2 users in the system.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3495-0
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.280
There is A1 Interviewer and
there is one Interviewee OK and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3495-1
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.150
as a Interviewer I can just go
and upload my resume.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3500-0
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:38.750
OK, so if you see.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3512-0
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.120
So yeah, let's just say user
comes and uploads.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3518-0
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.920
It's resume.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3547-0
00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:47.276
So what we are doing, we are
keeping all the information and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3547-1
00:18:47.276 --> 00:18:50.897
related to the resume and we are
getting the contacts out of that

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3547-2
00:18:50.897 --> 00:18:51.720
particular PDF.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3579-0
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.981
We are saving that into our
database and at that point in

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3579-1
00:18:55.981 --> 00:18:59.974
time basically that particular
context will be used in

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3579-2
00:18:59.974 --> 00:19:03.750
subsequent further calls for the
interview session.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3615-0
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.110
So it is very basic flow where
we are just collecting that

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3615-1
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:14.351
assume information OK if we go
to the next floor that is the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3615-2
00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:18.390
main flow where actual interview
is happening.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3619-0
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.710
So if you see.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3625-0
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:23.330
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3633-0
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.860
So candidate needs to provide
one particular resume ID.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3636-0
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.090
Maybe what?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3661-0
00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.001
He or she already uploaded in
the previous screen, and once

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3661-1
00:19:33.001 --> 00:19:36.050
that is there, there is one you
can say.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3681-0
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.637
The API layer is there and we
will be getting our storing all

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3681-1
00:19:39.637 --> 00:19:41.310
the chat history information.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3694-0
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.826
So for the first interaction,
definitely there wouldn't be any

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3694-1
00:19:44.826 --> 00:19:45.550
chat history.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3723-0
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.454
So for the subsequent call, we
will be fetching that chat

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3723-1
00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:53.188
history as well so that we can
prompt or provide so those

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3723-2
00:19:53.188 --> 00:19:54.540
responses to the LLM.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3756-0
00:19:54.890 --> 00:20:00.088
And yeah, once once we have the
context we have, let's just say

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3756-1
00:20:00.088 --> 00:20:05.125
some question from the candidate
side and we would be sending

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3756-2
00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:08.130
these information to our LLM
system.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3771-0
00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:12.070
So right now we are using prompt
flow for all our endpoints.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3789-0
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.951
So once we send these
information to prompt flow,

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3789-1
00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:19.520
prompt flow will be providing us
the response as a.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3815-0
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.401
Interviewer so they would be
asking a question and let's just

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3815-1
00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:26.570
say as a candidate how we are
responding.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3834-0
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.983
So those interactions would be
happening through our prompt

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3834-1
00:20:29.983 --> 00:20:33.216
flow and those interactions
would be happening through a

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3834-2
00:20:33.216 --> 00:20:33.500
text.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3847-0
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.900
So we have one particular Azure
services as well in place.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3877-0
00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.464
So it would be converting text
to speech and speech speech to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3877-1
00:20:41.464 --> 00:20:44.960
text and all the interactions
that we would be seeing on the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3877-2
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.310
screen would be happening
through audio.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3889-0
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.220
So this is this is the main
Interviewer.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3899-0
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:54.096
Your Interviewee interaction,
where the interview is actually

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3899-1
00:20:54.096 --> 00:20:54.720
happening.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3919-0
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:59.207
Apart from that, we have one
more flow where we are seeing

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3919-1
00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:02.080
that it is a Interviewer flow
just one.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3950-0
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:09.127
Yeah, this is the last flow
where let's just say as a

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3950-1
00:21:09.127 --> 00:21:13.974
Interviewer, I want to maybe
know what all questions I can

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3950-2
00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:15.700
ask from a candidate.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3993-0
00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:20.057
So here I can just upload a JD
job description and based on

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3993-1
00:21:20.057 --> 00:21:24.182
that we will be just extracting
information from that and

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3993-2
00:21:24.182 --> 00:21:28.662
getting the context and we will
just send those information to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/3993-3
00:21:28.662 --> 00:21:29.800
our prompt flow.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4027-0
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:34.856
There would be a like apart from
this context we will be sending

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4027-1
00:21:34.856 --> 00:21:39.326
a prompt and based on that it
the system will provide us with

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4027-2
00:21:39.326 --> 00:21:41.850
easy, moderate and hard
questions.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4038-0
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.300
So yeah, that's about all the
flows that we have, so.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4058-0
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.406
I can give you a UI demo of the
whole flows that we talked

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4058-1
00:21:51.406 --> 00:21:51.840
about.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4068-0
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:55.610
Thank you, Siva.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4071-0

Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4076-0
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.010
Let me share my screen.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4086-0
00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.210
Let me know once my screen is
visible.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4092-0
00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:13.600
Yeah, this is.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4146-0
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.965
Yeah, this is the initial screen
when we can, when we came into

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4146-1
00:22:18.965 --> 00:22:22.656
the application, some
application we will be seeing a

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4146-2
00:22:22.656 --> 00:22:26.689
button called here like when
user clicks on the click here

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4146-3
00:22:26.689 --> 00:22:30.859
button we will be showcasing a
dialogue box by having it two

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4146-4
00:22:30.859 --> 00:22:33.730
options called interviewer and
interview.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4171-0
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.879
If user uploads and interview by
uploading a job description,

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4171-1
00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:42.514
we'll be getting the
questionnaires as uh, Shubham

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4171-2
00:22:42.514 --> 00:22:43.940
Express just before.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4181-0
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.440
Once we upload any job
description of that user.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4191-0
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.490
We'll be fetching the questions
for that job description.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4201-0
00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.680
You can see the response in the
bottom.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4205-0
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:03.770
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4231-0
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.699
And in the back end here we are
using prompt flow to fetch the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4231-1
00:23:07.699 --> 00:23:11.120
questions from the context
within the job description.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4233-0
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.980
These are the questions.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4243-0
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.680
Easy questions and moderate,
difficult and hard.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4246-0
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:16.430
Questions three.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4265-0
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.931
Yeah, types of questions, we
will be displaying for this user

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4276-0
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:25.467
And sure, Shubham and Ruthran
like you guys have not

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4265-1
00:23:21.931 --> 00:23:22.340
once.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4276-1
00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:27.320
implemented streaming here.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4281-0
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.960
No.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4286-0
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:30.980
So not yet.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4302-0
00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:35.857
We haven't implemented that, but
yeah, we we can do that in

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4302-1
00:23:35.857 --> 00:23:36.970
future, so we.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4303-0
00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:36.870
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4305-0
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.340
Evening.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4314-0
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.910
Do it as a best practice for
whole thing.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4329-0
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.561
You know, maybe this will come
from Satya, but I'm just my

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4329-1
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:45.410
suggestion, OK?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4353-0
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:49.400
Because the you know the weight
time is going to be, everything

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4337-0
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.550
Umm.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4353-1
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.660
is going to the wait time, right
response time, correct?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4381-0
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:55.910
So for every chat interaction,
if you implement it, I think

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4381-1
00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.197
there is going to benefit, you
know, and it become a practice,

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4381-2
00:23:59.197 --> 00:23:59.510
right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4423-0
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.524
So for anything that we do or
will forward, so then we don't

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4423-1
00:24:02.524 --> 00:24:05.578
need to axe or remind you guys
saying that this is what needs

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4405-0
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:03.300
Yes, into.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4423-2
00:24:05.578 --> 00:24:07.450
to be done in support of this,
right?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4464-0
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.687
So because there is one of the
challenges we face, remember in

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4449-0
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.290
Yes, yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4464-1
00:24:11.687 --> 00:24:13.760
terms of performance, OK,
continue.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4451-0
00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:12.480
Umm.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4477-0
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.400
We were asked to migrate from
Langchain to prompt flow and we

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4477-1
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.320
got very limited time, so this
is just an analysis of Sam.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4474-0
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.570
Umm.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4490-0
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:25.020
OK, if you're planning to do it,
fine.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4488-0
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:23.270
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4502-0
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.510
If not, then you know, just
think about it.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4505-0
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.260
Yeah, sure, yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4512-0
00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.090
Yeah, but it's just you.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4521-0

So we can discuss about the
Interviewer flow.

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:09.660
Bye bye.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4712-0
00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.290
So yeah, we can just upload a
resume here.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4716-0

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4748-0
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:25.866
OK, so basically once the resume
is uploaded good, we are just

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4748-1
00:26:25.866 --> 00:26:30.386
giving one button to in start
the interview based on those

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4748-2
00:26:30.386 --> 00:26:33.910
particular resume that the user
has approved.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4753-0
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.050
Yeah.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.980
So here as as I.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4778-0
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.546
OK, so right now the system is
actually speaking whatever tax

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4778-1
00:26:51.546 --> 00:26:53.750
you guys are seeing here.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.115
So I think it might not be
audible to you guys, but the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4802-1
00:26:57.115 --> 00:27:00.273
system will be automatically
saying that text that is

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4802-2
00:27:00.273 --> 00:27:01.150

So all the interaction that on
this screen is happening is

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4819-1
00:27:04.443 --> 00:27:05.590

00:27:09.824 --> 00:27:13.750
taken from the context that was
uploaded in there itself.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4844-0
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.550

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.140
I I'm a software developer.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4861-0
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.450

Yes, so here this is the part
where it candidate can give the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4884-1
00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:46.480

00:27:51.444 --> 00:27:55.334
background so Shubham can use
the audio functionality to do

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4969-2
00:27:55.334 --> 00:27:59.030

My name is Shiva moja.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4950-0
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.740
I'm here to give an interview
today.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4958-0
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.340
What all the questions I should
be expecting?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4968-0
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:26.400
OK, not sure like me.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4973-0
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.840
Super.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5000-0
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:37.209
Probably introduce yourself as a
the candidate, not yourself,

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/4987-0
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:36.330
OK.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5000-1
00:28:37.209 --> 00:28:39.370
because it's not able to.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5001-0
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:41.090
Umm, no, I think some audio
issues there, but yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5020-0
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:26.445
Hi I'm a software developer with
seven years of experience in

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5020-1
00:29:26.445 --> 00:29:27.050
Python.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5028-0
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:51.350
OK.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5034-0
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:07.550
Should don't.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5046-0
00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.520
Don't wait for the audio to play
just to go ahead.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5059-0
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:17.628
OK currently I'm working on a
rack component which is using

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5059-1
00:30:17.628 --> 00:30:18.080
LLM.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5072-0
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.120
Yeah, actually like Shubham
stopped in the middle.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5080-0
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:32.790
So there is a bit of issue.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5104-0
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.836
So basically the idea in this
screen is like a candidate can

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5104-1
00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:40.210
come and keep on answering the
questions which are LLM.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5115-0
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.470
Has and once the interview gets
completed.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5121-0
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.270
Basically it will show a.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5135-0
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.030
It will show some strength and
weaknesses to the candidate.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5159-0
00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:53.666
Later on we can add more
features or more metrics or to

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5140-0
00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.200
OK.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5159-1
00:30:53.666 --> 00:30:57.423
how the edge of how the
candidate performed in the

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5159-2
00:30:57.423 --> 00:30:58.160
interview.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5173-0
00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.530
And yeah, this is the main idea
in this screen.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5180-0
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.800
Better.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5195-0
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:03.770
Yeah, just.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5187-0
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.660
So maybe let me try it.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5196-0
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.440
Just say conclude the interview.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5189-0
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:04.970
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5216-0
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:08.710
Yeah, let me try to conclude
that and the interview.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5204-0
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.860
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5215-0
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.920
Just to conclude the interview
and it'll conclude.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5229-0
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.920
Yeah, it seems that your audio
was misinformed.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5238-0
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:23.650
So this session might be
cancelled.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5250-0
00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.940
So yeah, maybe you can just end
close the session, yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5249-0
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:25.600
And.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5274-0
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:40.951
You're gonna have to speak
loudly, like otherwise it the IT

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5274-1
00:31:40.951 --> 00:31:42.510
was not recognizing my hope.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5275-0
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.450
OK, OK.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5282-0
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.620
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5292-0
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:47.240
I I think for some reason, yeah,
it was not able to.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5300-0
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.340
Hi I'm Shubham.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5306-0
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:04.300
I have seven years of experience
in Python.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5319-0
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:33.830
Hmm, OK.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5336-0
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.560
Uh, I think the resume is a
fresh.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5337-0
00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:41.170
Can you please end the
interview?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5342-0
00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:46.240
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5372-0
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.858
So what happened here is the the
resume is fresher and you

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5372-1
00:32:49.858 --> 00:32:52.120
introduced as seven year
experience.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5379-0
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.800
Like right, that it direct
correct.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5380-0
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:54.440
So that's why it's causing the
confusion.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5405-0
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.516
So at the end it should provide
a with a metric or in terms of

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5405-1
00:33:09.516 --> 00:33:12.360
the performance, how the
performance.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5420-0
00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.840
OK so.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5433-0
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:31.786
OK, since I don't go uh, since
that audio interaction was, it

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5433-1
00:33:31.786 --> 00:33:33.000
didn't go well.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5457-0
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.659
I think that's a feedback we
got, but otherwise it would just

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5457-1
00:33:35.659 --> 00:33:37.880
show proper feedback saying how
the interview went.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5460-0
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.200
Correct, correct.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5462-0
00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:40.590
Correct.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5470-0
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.040
Yeah, that was the all loving.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5503-0
00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:50.401
So when you say Feedback, you
set extral back or like it gives

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5483-0
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.640
Yeah.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5490-0
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:48.390
Maybe.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5503-1
00:33:50.401 --> 00:33:52.330
some numerical score as well.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5512-0
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.920
It's a textual Feedback
numerical score.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5517-0
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.300
We haven't got to that point
yet.

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5538-0
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.072
And the guys are you using as
your EA cells in the like no for

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5538-1
00:34:04.072 --> 00:34:04.390
this?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5553-0
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.040
Sorry, can you please repeat the
machine?

f97d9557-a17c-4bd8-aa1e-4debc3951ab0/5555-0
